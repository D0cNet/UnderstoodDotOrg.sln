Its simple, multisensory interface has great potential for use with kids with developmental or learning disabilities; anxiety or attention issues; language, hearing, or processing difficulties; or who may be learning English as a second language. Parents will develop schedules appropriate for their kids using text, pictures, audio clips, and videos. The schedules can be presented in five formats, each with a different way for a kid to check items completed and move on to the next. There is an option to have variable timing on steps in the schedule. "Choice boards" let kids indicate a preference from the choices, such as a reward for tasks completed.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[DRAGONBOX+ ALGEBRA exposes kids to basic algebra concepts by having them drag and drop little "cards" onto two trays on the screen. The goal is to isolate the sparkling box by itself, which is analogous to solving for x, but the algebraic concepts are presented in a way that makes them seem like rules to a game rather than mathematical concepts. It isn't until later that numbers, letters, and mathematical symbols start to appear gradually. As levels are solved, the various "dragons" grow, and players are awarded with stars for solving equations, using the fewest moves possible, and simplifying the equations.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[DragonBox+ is amazing: It is an app that is truly educational, rather than one that depends on an existing knowledge of the subject it purports to teach. It is not simply an interactive flash card app with multimedia bells and whistles thrown in. Learning the mechanics of the game is actually the act of learning concepts needed to solve algebraic equations, but the child doesn't even have to know that.The algebra is not explicit at the beginning and can be played even with no understanding of basic arithmetic until the final levels of the game. As far as kids are concerned, they are just learning a new type of puzzle game. The equations become more complex as the game progresses, and by the last level they take the form of standard "solve for x" equations. What is most surprising about the app is that young kids can learn fundamental concepts of algebra in a matter of hours.]]></csm:any_good>

DragonBox+ requires no prior knowledge of algebra or arithmetic, and only requires the ability to read the instructions that appear from time to time (or an adult to help read them).

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[No bells and whistles here: Awesome Xylophone is just about tapping tunes on this music app's colorful xylophone bars. This is a fun tool for younger kids to play around on and learn the names and tones of notes. All the child has to do is touch one of the eight bars on the screen, and a mallet drops down on it to make the sound. What's missing: the capability to save and play back songs, or to follow along with popular kids' songs by tapping highlighted notes. But it's still a solid choice for a simple music app.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Math Evolve is an almost seamless combination of arcade and math practice. To be successful, kids will need to know their addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division facts and sometimes do mental math computation with regrouping very quickly. As they solve math problems, they also fend off alien attackers. This gets harder with each level. Kids earn bonus points for solving series of problems correctly, which adds weapon upgrades. Kids can optionally practice with negative numbers. Practice mode lets kids practice all the same skills with different speeds (turtle-slow, rabbit-medium, cheetah-fast) and no enemies or shooting, still with the same music and backdrops of story mode. Math Evolve is a mainstream app. Kids who can access technology by a touchscreen, who can focus while being asked to think fast and multitask, and who know their math facts will enjoy this action-packed math practice. Kids who have trouble focusing with highly visible distractions, who are blind, or who have difficulty using a touchscreen will not have success.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Players collect bubbles containing numbers to solve basic math problems (3 + 4 = __), solving for the unknown (5 - __ = 1) and making their own equations (__ x __ = __).]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The fusion of arcade game, math, and beautiful graphics make MATH EVOLVE an engaging practice app. Kids have the option of three difficulty levels for math and three difficulty levels for gameplay. They can choose any or all of the basic math operations and whether or not to use negative numbers in the problems. In story mode they play arcade-style, and in practice mode they solve the math problems in a calmer atmosphere. Kids who might have trouble multitasking -- solving math problems while evading and shooting enemies -- may prefer practice mode over story mode.Practice mode also has an optional "tutor" feature; if kids make an error, a screen pops up with the equation and a keypad so they can can enter the correct answer and then continue play. The app supports up to five user profiles, and each profile generates statistics on the number of equations solved, the percentage correct, the rate of problem solving, and, in practice mode, mastery of specific multiplication and division facts.]]></csm:any_good>

The range of settings and two modes of play make it easy to customize the experience. Math Evolve is a great way to get kids hooked on practicing math facts.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

The app allows kids to insert words, images, and their own drawings to help kids who benefit from visual presentation. It also has many uses, including classroom use for instruction and student projects. The terms of service prohibit kids younger than 13 from creating accounts, but the developer's policy does allow for parent/guardian or teacher-created accounts to be overseen by an adult and used by kids.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[TOONTASTIC is brilliant in so many ways. It's a wonderful teaching tool, in that it clearly and concisely explains the fundamentals of storytelling (character, setting, story arc, etc.). And it's remarkably easy to create your own cartoons with it. The app allows kids to "animate" their characters by simply shuffling them around with their fingertips as they naturally would when playing with, say, paper dolls. The iPad records all the movements -- and all the character voices and narration that kids provide as they play -- and plays it back to us like a real animated film. Even the way the app lets you provide a musical score is genius: Kids can choose the emotions they want to convey (by picking the appropriate facial expression icon) and hear music that fits. And the final products can look really great. An update to the original release gave kids the welcome ability to save and re-use their custom-created characters and settings in multiple scenes. The number of characters and settings keeps expanding with the addition of themed scene packs -- though such packs much be purchased individually if you haven't bought the all-access pass.]]></csm:any_good>

Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers. The $4.99 app price buys you words in the categories of Animals, At Home, Colors, Shapes, and Vehicles. Tap "Get More Words" on the menu screen and more sets appear: holiday-themed words, Food Words, Clothes, and Numbers for $.99-$1.99 each (under 50 words each) or Spanish, German, and Japanese word sets (around 115 words each) for $4.99, or a French word set (36 words) for $1.99.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The best thing FIRST WORDS DELUXE for parents is definitely the different levels. Kids over 2 can drag and drop letters and build vocab and letter recognition pressing on objects featured and hearing what they are. As they get older, switch on the phonics every once in a while and help them sound out words. Once they're early readers and budding spellers, change the "Letter Order" setting from "Any Order" to "Left to Right." The only complaint here is the price tag of adding new words. When you add up what you could spend on all the different sets you may be tempted to scrap it all in favor of homemade flash cards at the kitchen table.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[iDress for Weather is an excellent and easy tool that helps kids understand weather and how to best prepare for it. Adults will want to do the initial set-up, but since the app relies on pictures rather than words, it's fully accessible to kids of any age, ability, or language.The customizable features set this app apart from others. Everyone experiences temperature differently, so iDress for Weather allows color-coded settings for specific temperature ranges. A familiar jacket or scarf can be comforting to a child, so upload pictures of your kid's favorite clothes to help ease the angst of getting out the door. Kids can learn to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius intuitively, with the help of pictures, rather than grappling with a clumsy formula. iDress for Weather may seem simple at first, but this gem can let kids of any age and ability gain independence with essential information to help them set forth on their day.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Jungle Time - learn how to tell time (for iPad) is a very interactive app for teaching kids how to tell time and to give them practice on five difficulty levels, teaching skills from telling time to the hour to telling time to the minute. Kids also learn to set clocks to the proper time, calculate elapsed time, and set elapsed time. A separate section teaches all about telling time, including how to read the clock and about daylight-saving time, 24-hour time, and time zones. There are plenty of hands-on examples of how the hour hand, the second hand, and time differences work. The settings screen has a large number of options for tailoring the game toward the proper skill level, including telling time to the hour, the half hour, five minutes, and one minute, for example. For kids with learning difficulties, the app includes a learning-clock style, which includes minute numbers, with color-coded hands.  Parents can track ther child's history within the settings section allowing the parent to see the date of activity and percentages correct and incorrect.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Kids who have mastered beginning concepts or who struggle with telling and setting elapsed time have the opportunity to learn how to master pragmatic language and how to differentiate between functional concepts such as behind and ahead.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Numbers League is an educational game where kids practice their basic math facts while helping superheroes fight evil villains. Set to music like an old fashioned crime show, kids can choose from five different game levels which fall on a spectrum from the most basic of arithmetic to negative numbers and multiplication. The idea of the game is to combine superhero head, body, and feet sections, each one with a number designation, to make a full superhero worth the body parts added together. Players then use superheroes individually or together to fight villains who also each have a total number value. A villain can be defeated if the total value of the superhero(es) selected is equal to the value of the villain. On some levels, special superhero devices can also be added to the superhero numerical value, which expand the range of the superheroes. On the more challenging levels, kids will need to compute totals with addition, subtraction, negative numbers, and multiplication. Once all of the villains have been captured, the game is over. Numbers League can be played as a solitaire game, against one of three robotic computer opponents, against several other human players, or a combination thereof.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Once players start a new game, options can be set to speed up aspects of the game, which can hide some of the on-screen math computation, change audio, set how many points hints cost, and turn a game timer on or off. These all combine for making the app grow with children, or to be a bigger challenge for adults. The options can also be changed mid-game if desired. In addition, kids can choose from five different game levels, depending on their skill level. The first time kids play, it might take some practice to understand the mechanics of the game.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids can bring out their inner super hero in Numbers League and capture villains with their math powers. Kids create heroes that add up to a sum and try to match that sum to each villain's designated number. Different strategies throughout the process can be used to attain the target number, such as adding multiple heroes' sums. The levels progress in difficulty so that by the last level, it requires a true hero with awesome math skills to succeed.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[NUMBERS LEAGUE is a fantastic educational math game for families to play together. It can be used as basic arithmetic practice, or it can be a challenging activity for adults who want to practice repeated addition or multiplying negative numbers in their head. It engages players with a storyline, fun comic book-style art, and interesting sound effects. Using math to solve real in-game challenges helps kids learn while they play and it makes math seem important. Kids will also have to use logic when creating new superheroes because their tableau can only hold seven superheroes at any given time. Any new superheroes made after that will have to replace one of the existing ones; and kids will need to figure out what superheroes they need to make to take on the existing villains.The app cleverly allows players to choose between an animated tutorial, where kids play along as they learn how the game works, or a basic tutorial where kids read through the instructions themselves. The many difficulty and option settings help players customize their experience. Since it is a different game each time it is played, it can be played again and again.]]></csm:any_good>

But we're not talking about just 5+3 or 6 x 9 -- to capture the villains, kids have to add, subtract, or multiply, sometimes all within the same problem, to get a target total. Plus, advanced levels include negative numbers. The app requires a bit of strategy and flexibility in thinking about how to mix and match the numbers. Kids defeat bad guys by doing math and can play either alone or with up to 3 others. Numbers League is an adaptive game that cleverly immerses kids in math within an exciting superhero environment.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

On the opening screen, kids meet the Duck Duck Moose cast of animals, one for each letter of the alphabet. For the main activity, kids hear and see a question at the top of the screen, then tap an animal to answer. The questions are about emotions, actions, activities, positions, or attire. For example, kids might get the question "Who is angry?"; to answer, they have to interpret the facial expressions of the eight animals.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[PEEK-A-ZOO BY DUCK DUCK MOOSE is a wonderful app for preschoolers and even toddlers. Its cute, colorful animal characters are appealing, and its simple point-and-touch controls can be mastered by anyone of any age. It schools very young children in the type of social and emotional learning that you don't see incorporated into many video games. Can your child recognize which animal is tired by seeing one of them yawn? Can she point out the angry animal by noticing the arched brows and frown? Plus, there's a lot about simply recognizing and naming common behaviors (waving, turning backwards, etc.). It's educational in a less-expected way.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Montessori Numbers is a set of math activities that follows the Montessori method of teaching. One tenet of Montessori schools is a hands-on approach, that movement is important for learning and cognition. So the Montessori curriculum involves a lot of objects that kids play with and use to build concepts. Montessori Numbers takes one specific set of objects, the blocks and number rods, and translates it to the digital world, using them in basic math activities that tap into counting and quantity. These activities are designed for kids to work with the materials. There is also a Building Game, which is less like a game and more like an opportunity for kids to explore and play with numbers on their own.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In Montessori Numbers, there are five activities. Four of the activities are a variation of one another where kids have to associate the numbers with the correct number of blocks and number rods, one is tracing. Kids can change the objects to depict more fun things like cupcakes and diamonds. Kids can also select the range of numbers they want to work with, which can go all the way up to 999.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Montessori Numbers does a great job of translating the Montessori method to the digital world. It allows kids to have that hands-on interaction with the blocks and number rods to help understand numbers and quantity. Number tracing adds more hands-on. It also captures the self-exploratory feel of Montessori schools.However, the app will not appeal to everyone. These activities require a bit of self-motivation as they present a basic task, but no goal. While Montessori Numbers provides the content, the amount kids learn and the connections they make between the objects and math concepts are up to them.]]></csm:any_good>

        <csm:what_kids_can_learn><![CDATA[Kids can learn to count and about numbers and quantity. The activities rely on the objects and number rods to show kids the relation between number and quantity. Kids can also choose to work with a specific range of numbers so they can personalize their learning. Working with the larger sets can allow kids to see more connections and even tap into addition or multiplication. For example, if the item is to put 40 objects in the area, then they can see that they can just put four 10-rods, and that 40 is just 10 four times. Overall, Montessori Numbers is a great way to expose kids to math in a meaningful way.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Calm Counter is a tool to help kids calm down using visual cues, counting backward from 10, and a deep breathing prompt. This simple yet powerful app includes two choices. There's a social story that reassures kids that we all get mad from time to time and then explains how to calm down by using the app's method in story form; there's also an "I need a break" exercise that kids can use to calm down. Calm Counter was designed for kids with autism and other challenges that may make it difficult to calm down, but this ingenious app's reminders for how to gather one's emotions could be useful for most any kid or adult.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[When you first purchase CALM COUNTER, listen to or read the social story to your kid to help them understand the gentle calming method that's provided on the other half of the app. Then, you can help your child tap the calming tool whenever he or she gets anxious or angry. Opening with the phrase, "I need a break," the screen turns bright red with a sad, mad face on it and the number 10. Tap the screen again, the screen color gets lighter and the face a little less angry and the number 9 is displayed. The colors, numbers, and faces continue to become lighter and happier with each tap, all the way to 1, where the kid is prompted to take a deep breath and see if they feel calmer.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Calm Counter can assist kids in getting a handle on angry or anxious emotions. The social story is brief, simple, and inclusive ("Everybody gets angry."). Many kids will likely feel quite reassured by the fact that a tool like this even exists, normalizing their emotions. The visual, verbal, color, and counting cues provide exposure to strategies in ways that may appeal to kids with different learning styles. If kids use this method consistently, it may become second nature to say "I need a break" and begin to calm themselves when they're getting angry or anxious -- with or without the app.]]></csm:any_good>

For example, the problem "Collect numbers that multiply to make 15" sets the player's marble off into the maze seeking to roll over the numbers 5 and 3 and avoiding the numbers 6, 7, and 4. Kids can also practice their money and time skills. Decision-making and strategy skills are inherent parts of this game as kids move their marble through the maze. Marble Math Junior is an exceptionally fun way to practice math.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Licking Letters uses a cute and encouraging frog to help kids practice identifying letters and spelling three-letter words. At the beginning of each round, a short word is shown and read aloud, and each letter is introduced. The letters then float across the screen; when one of the target letters is above the frog, kids tap the screen to watch the frog lick the letter. This continues until all letters in the word have been selected. Parents can choose whether the letters appear randomly or only in the correct spelling order. The first few rounds use three-letter words and only include the target letters, but the game gradually increases in difficulty. Completing a round earns a coin, which can be used to buy costume items for the frog. Some of the costume items show skulls or camouflage. Coins can also be earned in frequent bonus rounds that involve quick response times and a grumpy alligator.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In LICKING LETTERS, kids are shown a three-, four-, or five-letter word. Then, letters float across the screen and kids tap the screen when a letter in the target word appears. A frog licks the letter to add it to the word. Parents can adjust settings so letters appear in random order or only in the correct order. The game slowly increases in difficulty depending on performance, adding other distractor letters or increasing the length of the word. Kids earn coins to buy clothing for the frog, and fun bonus games appear every few rounds. Up to three players can save games on the device.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Licking Letters is a fun app that mixes a straightforward and repetitive spelling game with flashy costumes, quick bonus rounds, and encouraging words to keep kids interested and engaged. The game progresses in difficulty, and it's cool to be able to control whether or not the target letters appear in the correct order. Instructions are generally spoken, although kids will need to be shown how to play at the beginning. Unless they get bored, kids can play a lot of different rounds, making this app a great bargain.]]></csm:any_good>

Parents can set up the app so kids have to choose letters in order. That way, they can work on spelling and word recognition in addition to letter recognition. The game automatically adapts to kids' skill levels, but there's no consequence for choosing the wrong letter, which means kids can tap all the letters until they happen to spell the word. With parents nearby to reinforce learning, Licking Letters can be a great way for young kids to get more exposure to letters and words.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

If kids diverge from the tracing lines, the app requires them to start over. After tracing each item, kids flick or tilt the letters or numbers into a spinning vortex in a corner of the screen.

Kids can choose to work on only numbers, uppercase or lowercase letters, or short words. After tracing each item, kids have to flick or tilt the letters into a corner of the screen, where they fall into a vortex, adding a bit of fun.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Dragging Mr. Crab across letters or numbers through iWrite Words' numbered dots can be an engaging way to learn the correct sequence. However, the shaking visuals and squeaky sounds that happen when you trace off-track might be discouraging for some kids. Each time kids complete a word, a cute drawing appears, and kids can choose to watch a replay of their tracing. Sweeping the letters into the spinning vortex can be fun, too, although this could be confusing as the letters can become transposed in the process.Parents and kids can choose specific letters, numbers, and words to include, and they can change the size of the tracings with a simple swipe.

To get full use of this app, you have to purchase the Pro version or buy individual letters with an in-app purchase option. Using very specific exercises, games, and stories that focus on just one letter sound for 22 English language sounds, this app can improve pronunciation and understanding of how letter sounds form words. With more than 1,000 target words, kids will likely not get bored with this app. Adults have easy ways to track kids' progress and can track up to six kids at once.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[From the main screen, parents or teachers choose which of the 22 letter sounds they want kids to work on by tapping the corresponding letter (only "P" is free, the others are in-app purchases). For each letter, they can choose to work on "Words," "Sentences," or "Stories." Adults can tap on the light bulb icon to access tutorials with teaching tips specific to that letter sound. There are one or two games to choose from, such as flashcards or matching, and different levels within the three main play options. Letter sounds can be tailored to those that come at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. There are also many choices for data saving and sharing.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Since the free version of this app only provides one letter ("P") and the rest require in-app purchases for each one or a $49.99 purchase for the full Pro version, it's only fully useful if parents are willing to pay per letter or for the Pro version. If so, this colorful, multi-option app can be very useful to give kids tailored practice in letter sounds they have difficulty articulating. The stories are funny, and the exercises are ones with which kids are already familiar. This app also provides a lot of data to parents, teachers, or speech therapists to track kids' progress. A useful resource, just don't expect it to be free.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Word Wizard - Talking Movable Alphabet with Spell Check and Fun Spelling Tests is a fun speaking, spelling, short sentence practice, and phonics tool for kids who are just learning to spell and play with letters. The spelling word lists and the option to create your own spelling study list are key features. On the open spelling board, an occasional mispronunciation can get through. For example, the word "awesome" is still pronounced correctly even when "e" is totally omitted from the word. Unless a child is coached to know the slight red glow around a word means it's misspelled, he or she may not keep trying for the correct spelling if the pronunciation sounds right.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

On the movable alphabet board, kids place letters into boxes as they hear each individual sound add to the others to build a word or sentence. Choose Spelling Quizzes, and dozens of built-in word lists pop up as well as the option to create your own, which is as easy as entering the list title and typing in the words. The options to customize include changing the voice speed and tone, American or UK pronunciation, and more. There are lots of tips built into the spelling tests, and fun rewards.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The spelling lists and the ability to make your own lists for kids to practice for their school spelling test make WORD WIZARD worth buying. It's also fun for kids to spell their own words or sentences and hear them spoken back by a computerized voice speaking UK or American English; settings can also change the voice via speed and tone. But be aware this is not a perfect word-to-voice translator: Kids may misspell some words and still have them auto-pronounced correctly, so you may want to clue them into looking at the red glow around incorrectly spelled words and remind them to keep trying or ask for help so misspelling isn't reinforced.]]></csm:any_good>

Spelling on the talking alphabet board is fun for word-creation free play. The pronunciations are not 100 percent accurate, however, and the app will not correct misspelled words on the open spelling board; wrong words do glow slightly red. Spelling lists and tests are more accurate, they give hints, and won't let kids move forward until they spell the word correctly. Word Wizard helps kids improve their spelling through pre-made lists and by playing with word building on their own.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

The developer stresses that the three modes -- Write It, Tap It, and Pinch It -- are exercises, not games. While there are elements built into each activity to make them more interesting to kids, this app is mostly for therapy and practice. Kids who need extra help tracing letters, using their fingers in specific ways like pinching, and keeping certain fingers steady while moving others can benefit from using this app. The automatic tracking and reporting features will likely be valuable to parents, teachers, and therapists.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[First, choose Tap It, Pinch It, or Write It. In Tap It, lines appear with colored triangles on the ends that kids need to tap while keeping a thumb on the "anchor dot." In Pinch It, pinch small crabs to make them disappear; difficulty increases as crabs begin to move, change color, and multiply. Write It gives kids verbal and visual prompts to trace capital or lowercase letters as well as numbers. When kids touch the blue dots within the letters, a dinging sound lets them know they've hit the right spots.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[DEXTERIA - FINE MOTOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT is a well-made therapeutic app for kids who need extra help with fine motor skills, letter formation, and skills like finger pinching -- skills that help in many ways, including manipulating mobile device screens. While the exercises aren't chock full of exciting games, cute characters, and rewards, features like fun sound effects, timed tasks, and encouraging tracking of levels completed can help keep kids' attention. This sustained attention is key, because these activities are only fully effective if incorporated into daily practice. With consistent use, Dexteria can be a highly effective tool.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Phonics Genius is a great app for kids with prior reading experience to improve their reading skills. It intelligently organizes words by letter or letter combination sounds and lets kids practice phonemic awareness and build sight words. Phonics Genius also boosts confidence and challenges kids to try reading new, more complex words.Phonics Genius falls short, however, on two key fronts. First, the app doesn't have common letter combinations that are essential for beginning readers, such as -at, -et, and -it words. The app also lacks an easy way to customize flash card sets to a show a specific word length in a set. Beginning readers can handle three- and four- letter words ("ship," for example) but may get overwhelmed with larger words that, by default, are in the same set with the same letter sound (i.e. "sheepskin," for example). As is, Phonics Genius is best for kids who are emergent readers with previous reading experience.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Freefall Money provides kids with a fun way to practice counting money with coins. There are three different modes of play: Fill the piggy bank with the requested amount of money using different combinations of coins; enter the amount of money available; and add up a group of coins. Gameplay is very straightforward and will likely require no adult instruction; games are based on simply swiping the coins and dumping them into the correct bank or group, or choosing correct numbers on a number pad. Some basic knowledge of how much coins are worth and the real-life concept of counting money is probably necessary first before kids will fully comprehend these games. Kids are rewarded for playing by earning tropical fish for a tank and then being able to clean the tank and feed them.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

In Scatter Mode, kids fill a piggy bank with a requested amount of money by tapping on the correct coins scattered around the screen. In Type Mode, type in the amount of money being shown with coins on the screen. Cluster Mode asks kids to add groups of coins. Once kids answer a few questions correctly, they get to tap on fish rewards to put into their virtual fish tank, which they can also clean and drop fish food into for fun.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Elementary school-age kids who already know a bit about money but want to practice counting coins can play FREEFALL MONEY's three games and will likely keep coming back for more because of the fun fish tank reward system. In addition to the money practice, adding coins is also just good, basic math practice. Kids who are just starting out with money can limit the number of coins used to help make the game more manageable for their current skill level.Earning fish for the tank is a fun way to reward kids for play. Counting coins on a screen may not seem like something most kids would enjoy, but the engaging games here that include clear, simple directions and lots of colorful rewards are worth their weight in gold for practice in counting money.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids also gain practice in counting by 5s, 10s, and 25s simply because of the values of the coins. Unless a parent is available to help, it helps if kids are already familiar with the values of each of the coins (nickels are worth 5 cents, for example). Freefall Money provides fun practice in counting, adding, and visually estimating how much groups of coins are worth.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that BeSeen is an innovative simulation of a high school's social network that teaches kids about being safe and responsible online. Players create a profile with a gender and class year, then progress through one year of school. Players read posts by other characters and choose from options to make status updates and respond to other characters. The choices revolve around social media challenges, such as sharing locations, photos, and gossip. Choosing the better option often is rewarded with a new friend or a award like "drinking drama diverted" or "sexting scandal salved." Missed opportunities for awards are also shown, and some situations show long-term, rather than immediate consequences. The player's mom is automatically added as a friend, and she occasionally provides feedback on the player's choices. The site deals with mature issues, such as child pornography laws, bullying, and sexual predators, but the photos and language are not explicit. Kids can share their progress on Facebook, but this is optional.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Educational value" rating="5"><![CDATA[Through simulation, kids can learn about short- and long-term consequences of their choices about online interactions. Kids will practice choosing among potential status updates and wall posts to learn how to navigate sharing information and photos and to help defuse online tensions and bullying. Kids can also practice using process of elimination in the cipher games.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

Kids can create a profile by selecting a cartoon image and typing in their interests and activities. Subsequently, all text is provided by the game in a multiple-choice format. While some of the choices are rather obvious, some are more nuanced. The game can run at normal speed or at double or triple speed. Playing more than once is generally necessary in order to win all the awards, but doing so requires creating a new profile and shows only minimal variation. A cipher game, where kids must select three out of six characters and put them in the correct order left to right, shows no variation in difficulty.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

In the "protected from predator" challenge, kids can choose whether to share a photo of themselves in a somewhat scanty Halloween costume, which draws the attention of a new friend who asks for more "sexy photos" and suggests meeting for a date. (This is quickly shot down by the player's mom.)]]></csm:content_grid_item>

Menu options include dashboard, profile, friends list, inbox, awards, and a game. On the dashboard, teens are prompted to interact with friends by updating their status, commenting on a friend's status, or responding to a message. Teens must choose between three options, each displaying a different degree of online safety and responsibility. Teens are rewarded with new friends and awards for making safe and responsible choices.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[BESEEN is an important app and admirable in many respects. The challenges about how to respond to a friend's post are often relatively nuanced, and the length of the simulation allows kids to understand the short- and long-term impacts of their choices. The simulation does a decent job of capturing the personalities and drama of high school, with diverse characters and interests. Still, kids may feel that the clunky menus and the cheesy language make this app seem childish and repetitive, particularly when playing the game more than once. A few terms are conflated, such as characters describing sexting as online sharing, which makes the app seem out of touch. This impression is reinforced by the unchallenging and tedious cipher game. Despite these small flaws, the app (with support from teachers and parents) has a lot of potential to teach kids about navigating tricky social media situations that face high schoolers.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that SpellingCity is a companion app for the website www.spellingcity.com, where teachers and parents can create customized word lists to help kids improve spelling, vocabulary, and grammar. The app has a lot of flexibility making it helpful for kids who need alternative ways to learn how to spell. It also has an audio component that can help kids who have difficulty comprehending words and spoken language. SpellingCity is designed for kids in grades K-12, but getting started and navigating the app will be tricky for younger users who are just learning to read. It's most helpful when kids can access a web-based SpellingCity word list customized by a parent or teacher in order to practice words they're studying at home or school.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

It works in partnership with the SpellingCity website, where parents and teachers can create word lists for kids to practice and study on the website or app. Parents and teachers can upgrade their SpellingCity.com account to a Premium membership, which includes enhanced features like individual student logins, student data tracking, and premium games and activities. Premium accounts are $29.99 per year for a family and $49.99 per year for a single classroom.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids can choose a spelling list from the 10 sample lists or search for a list by username, teacher name, parent name, or school zip code. Once they pick a list, kids can choose one of six activities including hangman, matching, sentence unscramble, and a spelling test. The app is best if used in partnership with a parent or teacher's SpellingCity web account. If a parent or teacher has a Premium account, kids can login with a username and password and the app will keep records of their performance on the activities.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SpellingCity is a great assessment tool, particularly for classroom teachers and homeschooling parents. Even if kids don't have access to a student login for SpellingCity, the app's engaging and colorful interface draws them in and offers fun ways to build spelling, vocabulary, and grammar skills. The pre-recorded audio playback reinforces learning and custom spelling lists motivate learners with words that are relevant (for teaching specific subjects or to learn various spellings of a root word, for instance).It's important to note that the app is meant for student use only; there's no teacher or parent login available in the app. In addition, kids and parents can't use SpellingCity to make their own spelling lists -- this has to be done on the website. And in order for the app to save any learning data, kids must have access to a student login, which is only available if a parent or teacher has a Premium membership.]]></csm:any_good>

Unfortunately, the photos lack diversity -- nearly all of the kids and adults in the photos are white. And for the price, it would be nice if the app provided parents with some guidance to help kids get the most out of this app. A parent/teacher center with suggestions for supporting language development and ideas for extension activities would be a nice addition.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Fotobabble is a creation tool that lets users add narration to photos and then share them publicly via email, text message, and social media. The privacy settings default to public and include the option to share location, which raises concerns. The app requires a free Fotobabble web account (users must be 13 or older) and stores creations within the app and on the user's online profile. Fotobabble definitely lets teens jabber on about their photos, but they'll need guidance on privacy, appropriate use, and online safety if they're going to use it.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Users can make their accounts and photos private in the account settings menu, but anyone with a link can still access a photo that is set to private. The app has optional location sharing for each photo, though this is turned off by default.

Users can share a link to their photo via Facebook, Twitter, email, or text message. Shared photos live on the user's Fotobabble website profile page.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[FOTOBABBLE differs from other photo sharing apps because it infuses pictures with the energy and emotion of voice. Teens may post talking photo status updates on Facebook or Twitter, but imagine sending audio postcards describing travel adventures or emailing singing greeting cards to family and friends. Teachers could use Fotobabble to make talking flashcards to teach foreign language vocabulary or to differentiate instruction for a variety of learners, such as using audio flashcards to help special need students learn life skills and identify emotions. Kids could even make talking slideshows about a field trip, science experiment, or an afternoon hanging out with friends.Some things in life are better suited for video or still photos. But if a picture says a thousand words, then adding voice to it with Fotobabble can create an even more captivating and memorable experience. Just be sure teens are aware of the privacy issues with this app and understand the responsibilities and consequences of dealing with social media.]]></csm:any_good>

This skill can help kids focus on details, which is important for learning many skills, and which may be especially challenging for kids diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Go Go Games offers three games, each of which shows kids a set of objects and asks them to match an object with another that looks the same. The developer explains that the games were designed based on a therapy that helps kids master the ability to notice multiple features in the objects around them.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Each game has unique characteristics, but the basic learning premise is similar in all three. For example, in Wheels &amp; Roads, kids must guide a car along one of three roads. Each road has a sign depicting a car, and kids must identify the correct road by matching their car to the sign. Kids must match six objects correctly before moving to the next level.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[GO GO GAMES helps kids learn one main skill -- to quickly notice the features that make certain objects different or the same. This skill can help kids learn in many ways, from learning to read to social interaction. Some of the details kids must notice while playing these games are quite specific; this may be a simple concept, but these games aren't necessarily easy for kids who struggle with this concept.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[On the menu screen, kids and parents can choose from six locations: hairdresser, mall, doctor's office, playground, grocery store, and restaurant. Each includes a set of 12 photographs with a child modeling the expected and appropriate behaviors for each setting. With each photograph, kids see the text and hear a child narrator. For example, at the doctor's office, kids see a photo of a child in the waiting room and see and hear "I sit and wait my turn." Or at the mall, "I stay close to my dad" and "I keep my hands to myself."]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Model Me Going Places 2 is a valuable tool for parents, teachers, and therapists working with kids who need support in developing social skills. Each photo demonstrates a behavior or experience and provides clear and simple language kids can understand. Parents could review the photo sets with their kids before an outing to prepare them for the experience or after as a way to help kids reflect on their actions and behaviors.It's wonderful that the app is free, but it's clearly a teaser for the Model Me Kids line of DVDs. The demonstrations are fantastic, but are limited to six locations. In looking at the extensive collection of resources offered on the website, we're hopeful more of their content will be made available on mobile platforms.]]></csm:any_good>

Sometimes, it's quite challenging to discern which picture the app's creator intends the emotion to match, but choosing incorrectly simply results in a neutral sound and then kids can choose again. A correct choice comes with an approving sound and message. Kids and parents can customize the app with personalized audio and photos.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[TOUCH AND LEARN - EMOTIONS includes more than 100 images of real people -- kids and adults -- for kids to look at and match to specific emotions, such as "afraid," "hungry," upset," or "scared." Parents and teachers can customize the emotions and photos or adapt the learning to focus on one set of emotions if kids need extra help identifying a specific concept. Kids are rewarded with successful messages that can be customized as well.The app could use a bit more of a tutorial. And parents and teachers would benefit from some explanations so they can help kids understand why some rather ambiguous images are chosen to represent certain emotions. Fortunately, the settings options allow adults to adjust which images link to which emotions and set images to match more than one emotion. Overall, this is an excellent way for kids to practice identifying emotions, body language, and facial expressions.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Has your kid ever grumbled when asked to do something, then changed their response to excitement when you add, "I'll time you"? Now you can time them doing all sorts of things -- homework, reading, time-outs between siblings, bedtime routine -- with this practical, useful tool that can help adults and kids with time management. Once users create their timer(s), the app runs very smoothly. It's quite self-explanatory, and there are a number of prompts for new users. Just make sure your device's settings are on "awake" mode, so it doesn't enter sleep mode and that battery life isn't low, which could cause it to shut down. If you or your kid needs help staying on task, TIME TIMER could become one of those essential apps you use multiple times a day.]]></csm:any_good>

In some instances and for some kids, time pressure may even help boost productivity and creativity. This app may help kids learn to manage time-related stress and practice focusing to stay on task. Time Timer can help kids appreciate the value of time and use it well.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

Text to Speech translates typed words (emails, Word documents, messages typed directly into the app, and more) into an audio voice.

There are four voices to choose from for narrators: an American male or female and British male or female. Speak it!

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Depending upon why you're using SPEAK IT! TEXT TO SPEECH, it can either simply be an incredibly convenient way to listen to emails or articles while getting other work done, or it can be a truly life-changing tool for people with difficulty reading or speaking. The user interface is simple, and the accuracy of the text pronunciation is tremendously high. It would be nice if Speak it! Text to Speech could link directly with other apps and grab text from articles or emails, for example, rather than requiring users to cut and paste. Other than that one moderate suggestion, there's nothing here to find fault with. Highly recommended.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[CLAROSPEAK US can certainly be considered among the best available text-to-speech apps. There's not a lot of overt instruction, tutorials, or visual cues, but that's likely because the developer wanted to create a clean, sparse user interface to make it visually easy to work with. For tutorials, users have to go to the "i" tab and from there, exit to the developer's website for the user guide. For users who want a lot of customizable options, including highlighting, frequent playback of content, and Dropbox compatibility, ClaroSpeak US is an excellent option.]]></csm:any_good>

Parents or teachers can make photo books of kids' favorite stories, family photos, vocabulary words, and almost anything else they need to practice vocabulary skills. There's a 32-page tutorial on the app and its developer's website, which most first-time users will need to follow because the process of making the pages and books isn't intuitive. There are many features here, including uploading images from your device's camera or the Internet, adding your own voice or using text-to-voice audio, and creating "hot spots" on the pages that kids can tap to hear and see the word associated with the object in that section of the page. Once parents or teachers master the basics, Scene Speak can grow into a customized resource that's easy for kids to use.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[For parents who want to customize sequences of images, books, photo albums, and more for their kids, Scene Speak may be just the right app. There's a 32-page tutorial that is essential reading to get the most out of the features and to make VSDs (pages) that will be effective. Settings include being able to record your own voice or your kid's voice, using prerecorded text-to-voice, or not using audio at all. The "hot spot" feature is particularly helpful in highlighting details of a page for kids to tap and hear specific words. For the price, it would be nice to see more on-screen prompts or a video tutorial, rather than wading through such a long written help section. Still, with a bit of patience, Scene Speak can become a go-to tool to create books and pages to help your kid learn vocabulary, social stories, and more.]]></csm:any_good>

        <csm:what_kids_can_learn><![CDATA[Kids can learn vocabulary and context on Scene Speak. Kids can also practice naming, listening, and speaking, if they are prompted to repeat the words they hear. Depending on the pages that parents or teachers create on Scene Speak -- and especially if kids use the "hot spot" feature -- kids can also learn about part-whole relationships. For example, if a kid taps on a hot spot of him- or herself in a class photo and hears the phrase "I am a classmate," that can help make the connection that they are a part of the class. Scene Speak is a useful tool to help kids learn words in the context to which they belong.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Playful Minds: Math (5-8) is an educational app that drills kids' math skills and stretches kids in multiplayer mode as they compete against other kids in math mini-games. The app is meant to grow with the child and provides training from kindergarten to second grade. There are five profiles, so this can be a bargain for multi-child families. Parents also need to know that in multiplayer mode kids cannot exchange information, but parents should use a nickname when they set up the child's profile if they prefer that their real names not be seen at all. The game can be played perfectly well without the Report Card feature, but if you want to continue using the app after a year, a yearly subscription of $6.99 must be bought. The app is not compatible with older devices, so parents will need to check the tech requirements.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Kids start by creating an avatar that moves from game to game. They earn trophies and certificates and unlock character clothing and accessories as they complete exercises; they buy the character items with gold they also earn from playing games. The multiplayer mode is a set of competitive mini-games, and is safe as there is no interaction between the kids -- but kids can see how well other kids are doing graphically. Each child also gets questions suited for his or her level, so all kids have a chance to win.The major downside for the app is that it is incompatible with older devices.

The app includes photo and video modeling as well as rewards for scheduled activities and behaviors. The library of photos and videos includes items such as brushing teeth, eating breakfast, getting on a school bus, going to the grocery store, and more. Parents or teachers can also add their own videos. For kids who respond well to visual cues and rewards, My Video Schedule could be an invaluable tool to help reinforce structure and necessary tasks in their daily life.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[MY VIDEO SCHEDULE is a good way to help kids who need visual cues as reminders. There's a wide array of tasks and activities here, from getting dressed to going to class, cleaning the house or going shopping. The more than 100 videos cover a lot of material, but if you don't find a video that fits the activity or task you're entering into the schedule, you can create your own. The one downside of so many videos on My Video Schedule is that, even though they are categorized, it can take quite a while to scroll through so many before you find the right one. In future versions, it would be nice to see a keyword search feature for faster scheduling. That said, as it is now this app could be a very useful tool to provide modeling, structure, and rewards to kids who respond well to visual cues.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Proloquo2Go is an extraordinary communication aid for kids who need talking assistance. The award-winning, multi-user app is set up in a customizable grid that uses colorful icons placed in "buttons." These buttons represent words that kids can tap to say individually or to form complete sentences. This app can be used for a wide range of speech, from very basic communication (a 3x3 grid for the most basic requests, such as food) to creating fluid sentences and conversations (up to an 8x8 grid, providing 64 up-front words, with many more options within categories). Users can also add their own photos and images to create icons, edit existing buttons, move them, or search by keyword.While there are a number of apps that fall into the category of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools, Proloquo2Go is unique in many ways. The app can increase or decrease the complexity of words and phrases presented based on a kid's current age and vocabulary. Also, the downloadable voices include those of children (British or American, boy or girl). As a result, kids using the app can be represented with more natural voice tones. Kids who can type can also use this app for text-to-speech, with many customizable settings on this feature as well.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

As a kid uses it, adults can assess what adjustments need to be made to overall page organization and which words and phrases should be added, prioritized, or deleted to best suit their individual needs. Excellent tutorials, including webinars, as well as a user manual, in-person seminars, trainers, and 250 resources centers worldwide offer additional support.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

The Home grid appears with basic words and images in boxes in a 6x6 grid, which can be altered to suit your kid's needs. Kids tap on the desired boxes with images (called "buttons"), and they appear above the grid where the words are spoken consecutively. PROLOQUO2GO contains extensive customizations and many helpful tutorials.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Kids who can't speak or have limited speech but who gravitate toward technology will likely be able to use Proloquo2Go adeptly. With a tap, a swipe, and a tap, kids can drill down into the app to find just the right buttons that represent what they want to say. Words are organized in grids by most frequently or recently used, sets of things, general parts of speech (pronouns, verbs, nouns), and "little" words, which help make sentences more fluid, conversational, and even polite ("I want to go play baseball, please."). For parents or teachers who wonder if they can customize an app with such an enormous vocabulary base (14,000 symbols), Proloquo2Go offers an extensive user guide, FAQs, webinars, and more that make the experience easy and even fun. Even for kids who can't read, the symbols used along with the words are so highly customizable that they can use it to express themselves without knowing words. As long as a kid is able to navigate the device's screen and understands how symbols can represent words, including verbs and pronouns, they most likely will be able to use this tool to speak not only to ask for what they want or express how they feel, but also to speak in complete sentences and participate in the flow of everyday communication.The $219.99 price tag is definitely higher than similar apps; however, there are no added costs (voice downloads included) and all of the webinars and online instruction are included. The extensive available support for parents who are setting up and optimizing the use of Proloquo2Go for kids is impressive. Proloquo2Go can help speech-challenged kids increase communication and decrease frustration, and it empowers parents to customize this powerful tool in ways that best suits their kid's current age and stage of development.]]></csm:any_good>

Parents may want to stay nearby while kids view the video lessons as the YouTube video suggestions that appear after viewing the lesson could be inappropriate for children.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids have countless options to create faces using everyday objects such as food, candy, musical instruments, and toys, even customized sizes and shapes. They simply scroll through pictorial menus to choose their items and drag them into a facial outline. Kids can lock pieces into place, which allows them to layer other objects on top of each other. Kids can play the background music that comes with the app or add songs saved from the device (or turn off the music all together).]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The graphics are beautiful, and the interface is very easy for kids to maneuver. Most impressive, though, is the instruction in the video lessons taught by artist and children's book illustrator Hanoch Piven. Kids will come to look at everyday objects with an artist's eye. They can create alone or together with others, and then save their collages to the iPad's photos.Kids also have an option of collaborating with the world by uploading their creations to FaceWorld -- a free online gallery. While there, they can select art created by others, download it, modify it, and they choose to upload it to the world again. Parents will want to remind kids not to use their real names when sharing artwork.]]></csm:any_good>

They can experiment with placing different objects in different ways and see how easily a nut can go from being an eye to a nose with some creative flair. Kids will be encouraged to think about their choices, too, and the meaning different objects convey -- like using a light bulb for an eye can symbolize intelligence. Kids can get many ideas from the five video lessons, too. Faces iMake - Right Brain Creativity encourages kids to be creative and gives them the tools and ideas to express themselves.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Evernote is a widely used productivity tool that works across multiple platforms to facilitate access to lists, notes, images, sound, links -- almost anything! -- from multiple devices. The app is a great tool for students who need assistance with their executive functioning skills. Included within the app is the ability to make separate notebooks and tag notes for easy access, helping kids with organizational and planning issues. Kids can make separate notebooks for each subject area, and the notebooks are simple with a clean interface for kids who can be easily distracted. Students who benefit from color-coding, highlighting, or enlarged fonts can make these adjustments in the edit tool once they save a note. The microphone feature can be helpful for kids who have difficulty with verbal memory. The speak-and-read feature not only reads text, but also highlights text, which can help students who have auditory processing issues. Premium accounts, available by monthly or yearly subscription, allow sharing for multiple users, but even on the free account, you can share notes or links via email or social media.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

The beauty of the productivity app is that kids can access the information on Evernote from any device or computer. The information users can collect and save on Evernote seems limitless -- text, images, audio clips, photos, links, and more. The saved notes are searchable -- including the text within images. Notes can be shared via a link that users can email or share on social media sites as well as through other apps installed on the device.]]></csm:description>

The search function is great for finding specific pieces of stored information, though searching the text within images is hit or miss.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Word Bingo is a sight-word-recognition and spelling-game app for kids in kindergarten through third grade. Kids practice sight words as they play a bingo-style word game, a spelling practice game, and two other mini-games. Many of the words are chosen from the Dolch Word List of most commonly used sight words. Up to five players (and unlimited guests) can play on one app. The app compiles a scorecard for each registered player, and scorecards are listed by level so kids can view their improvements.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Also, it's important that players (or an adult) set the level and settings appropriately, otherwise sometimes the gameplay will be too hard, too easy, too noisy, or just not suited to the preferences of individual players. For example, in the spelling game, the spelling "hint" (which can be turned off in settings) is actually the entire word spelled out in shadow for the player.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[First, tap on How to Play to read WORD BINGO's instructions. Return to the main screen and tap Play. Choose a New Player tab to create a profile, then select a difficulty level, all nouns, or all words. Choose one of two main games (Word Bingo or Spelling Practice). For Bingo, a board with words appears. Listen to the word spoken and tap on it. When a row of four words is full, players earn a Bingo Bug. Other mini-games are accessible after kids drill into the app from the main menu.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Word Bingo can be a fun way for kids to practice recognizing and spelling sight words. The adorable little "bingo bugs" that kids earn after they play the games are a fun reward, and kids may get some motivation when they view their results page to keep working toward the next level. Most instructions are given verbally, which is good for younger kids. It can be tricky for kids to navigate, as not all games are presented on the main screen and, at different points of play, the app won't let you leave a game by pressing the usual X tab. Although it may not be perfectly organized for the smoothest user experience, Word Bingo is still a fun way for kids to practice sight words.]]></csm:any_good>

By choosing the appropriate level of skill and by playing the four fun games, kids practice nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, verbs, and more. Some parts of navigating the app aren't so intuitive and may require a parent's help to fend off frustration.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Remember The Milk is a task-organizing app that does much more than guard grocery lists. This app can be helpful for both parents and responsible teens (users must be 13 or older) who have difficulty with executive functioning issues such as goal-setting, prioritizing, time management and/or organization. The app helps kids juggle long to-do lists, complicated schedules, and multiple project deadlines. The simple user interface is intuitive; just type in the name of the tasks and organize according to name, list (work, home, school, etc.), priority, due date, and time. A task can use all these categories or just be listed by name and list. Task lists can be accessed via many different mobile devices as well as the related website and more sources such as Google Calendar. Users can input tasks even if they don't have wireless access at the moment of entry. Alarm reminders on iOS devices can include a "Moo," "Cowbell," or normal alarm sound. For people with really long task lists, there's even a keyword search option. Complete and Incomplete tabs make clear what's left to do, and it can provide a little rewarding lift when users can tap Complete.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

On iOS devices, swipe through task list components, divided into areas that work like stacked index cards for lists (today, this week, etc.), tasks, and then notes for each task. The Android app features a tap menu rather than swipe. Choose a list for your task, tap plus or Add Task, and type the task. A row of potential tags and options will appear, and you can choose what info you want to include for that task, its priority, and more. Add a note with extra info for the task, if desired. Tap the check mark when a task is completed.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[As with any task-organizing app, Remember The Milk is only as useful as the person entering and monitoring the progress and completion of tasks. But if used well and often, this app can help teens and adults stay on top of everything that needs attention. While the option to use this app across many platforms (iOS, Android, Kindle Fire, Outlook, and more) makes it easy to add and check lists often for up-to-date information, it also adds to the complexity of using this as a tool, especially if more than one person is adding items to the list.Making notes within tasks and tagging tasks adds detail and makes searching easy. Listing a task as ongoing on certain days brings a scheduling component to this task organizer. Finally, and perhaps most important, tap the check mark to mark an item completed, and it'll disappear, shortening busy users' lists for at least a few moments before the next item is entered.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Toca Tea Party brings little kids around the iPad for a traditional tea party but without the breakable, spillable teacups. Just about as adorable an app as is imaginable, the tea party includes a variety of pretty mini cakes and cookies, drinks, tablecloths, plates, and cups kids can choose from. Once kids get the tea party for three set up, they can invite their friends, stuffed animals, or parents around the iPad "table" to pretend to eat and drink by tapping on the food and drink on the screen -- and even "clean up" an imaginary spill on the table. As kids ask what their guests want to eat and drink and whether they would like more, they can tap on the items and hear tea pouring. The beauty of this app is it incorporates play with building on skills to help kids who have difficulty with understanding visual information and trouble with eye-hand coordination as well as fine motor issues as they follow visual directions at a tea party.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids simply start setting up the tea party on the iPad screen, which becomes the "table." Choose one of three tablecloths by tapping and dragging it to the center of the table. Then tap candles to light and drag the three plates to their places. Circles appear to show kids where to set items. Choose from four cups with three drinks (tea, lemonade, or hot cocoa) and the food. Then kids are prompted with, "Get your guests!" Bring everyone around the iPad table and start the party. Tap items to serve, eat, drink, refill, and even change the music on the radio. Enjoy!]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[TOCA TEA PARTY is an ingenious way to bring the classic tea party to kids without buying the mini tea set or cleaning tea stains off the carpet. Every aspect of the app -- from using a tablecloth to pretty little pastries and soft instrumental music -- sets the mood for kids to experience the atmosphere of a traditional tea party. This beautifully created app empowers little kids to make many choices as they create their tea party and as they pretend to host the tea party for their friends, stuffed animals, or parents. It's tea time anytime, anywhere with Toca Tea Party.]]></csm:any_good>

As they make choices for what items to include on the table and which food and drink to serve, kids exercise decision-making: "What do I think makes a good party?" Each planning choice shows social respect for their guests. If parents faciliate further exploration, kids also can practice shape recognition and counting various groups of cakes, cups, and more on this creative app. Toca Tea Party is a sweet pretend-play app that extends screen play into real life and helps kids build their imaginations.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

This app is especially helpful for kids who have problems with focusing and paying attention. Kids who need help staying on task will benefit from the ability to create customized timers and stopwatches; you can create alarms with your own ringtones as well as use descriptive, pre-made icons or your own photos and images stored on your device to label timers and alarms. Whether you want to time multiple kids on math practice tests at once, set a timer to count down and then count up, log and share past timers, or set your morning alarm with a customized ringtone using your own music, Timers4Me can do that. The $1.99 Plus version has extra options and no ads.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[TIMERS4ME - TIMER &amp; STOPWATCH is a full-featured, customizable app for multiple timers, stopwatches, and alarms. Three especially cool features that make this a standout timing-and-alarm app are the abilities to use your own photos as icons for timers and alarms, to run multiple timers at once, and to record pause times on stopwatches. For most parents and kids who use this app, the many options will be a benefit. For younger users, all those options may reduce ease of use; parents likely will need to help them set and use this app. During this review of the free version, the alarms, timers, and stopwatches all worked reliably. The only drawbacks to using the free version are the ads and the ability to see but not use some of the icons that appear on almost every screen. Overall, this is a solid timer and alarm app for parents to use themselves or to use with younger kids and for older kids to use on their own.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Noodle Words HD - Action Set 1 is the first in a series of "word toy" apps. This app helps emerging readers recognize 18 action words in a playful, unique way. This app is helpful for kids who have difficulty comprehending words and spoken words. The animation and verbal reinforcement can benefit kids who have difficulty understanding visual information and holding images in their memory. As the words illustrate their own meanings -- "pop" pops around the screen, "grow" sprouts leaves -- two irresistible little bugs also act out the same meanings in humorous ways. Noodle Words HD also can be a powerful way for kids who have difficulty reading or remembering word meanings to interact with words in a stress-free, playful way that may just help them see words in a new light. This app is an inspiring example of how creativity and humor can help kids learn.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Then view all 18 words on the "All" tab and choose one, or tap the on-screen box, out of which a word appears. As it does, listen to the bugs speak it, watch them act it out, and tap the word to watch the word act itself. Repeated taps result in new animations, all of which are hilarious. Tap the box again, or tap "All" to choose another word. Parents can tap "Menu" to view tips. Noodle Words HD is fun, out-of-the-box wordplay.]]></csm:description>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Motion Math: Hungry Guppy is a math game designed for the 3- to 7-year-old set. It's a "prequel" to Motion Math: Hungry Fish. This is a good introduction for kids who have difficulty understanding numbers as concepts and/or trouble understanding math language. Number hints spoken aloud help kids practice addition up to the number 5. Motion Math: Hungry Guppy's touch-and-drag functions are simplified for smaller, less-precise fingers, and there are no upsetting outcomes -- kids win but never lose.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In MOTION MATH: HUNGRY GUPPY, kids touch, drag, and combine one or more dotted (or numbered) bubbles to make a target number for a cute, hungry fish. The guppy will eat only one kind of bubble, such as one with two dots, three dots, or the number 4. As a well-fed guppy grows, players move to the next level. An unfed, hungry guppy shrinks until kids are reminded, for example, "This fish only eats 4's." There are three levels: dots, mixed dots and numbers, and numbers-only. Kids can skip around if needed, and number hints can be turned off. At various points, kids earn rewards or magic beads that can change a guppy's appearance.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Kids in the Hungry Guppy age range need lots of practice with the relationship between a number symbol, such as the number 2, and what it represents. This app uses excellent strategies to show them this relationship, moving gradually and purposefully from hands-on thinking (combining groups of dots) to more abstract ideas (adding 1 + 2). Strategic features anticipate where kids might go astray. Dots vary in their arrangement and appearance, so kids focus on a number rather than on matching a dot pattern or a color. Subtle visual and audio cues rein in kids who go rogue. For example, they learn quickly that trying to make mega-food bubbles is futile and not very fun. The app opens to a tutorial level, which means no waiting to play.The only negative is that this is a one-trick guppy. All kids do is feed the fish, with no variation in the gameplay. To help keep kids interested, the app offers extras such as collecting prizes.]]></csm:any_good>

It can also be helpful for kids with non-verbal learning issues, such as difficulty reading facial expressions or inability to read body language. With three characters and more than 100 props, kids can make a disco-themed zebra blow up a balloon, dress a giraffe in fiesta gear, or feed garlic to the mustachioed sheep -- all while observing the animal's reaction. This zany, open-ended play is a delightful way to introduce emotions.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Tap the sheep, the giraffe, or the zebra and that one character takes center stage. Swipe the lever for props and several fall into the scene. Kids then tap and drag the props to the animal for use. If they feed the animal ice cream they will see it react with joy. If its eyes begin to droop, it may be time for a snooze. Put the pacifier in its mouth. As the sky goes dark, the zebra's eyes close. Pull the alarm clock's rope...wake up! As kids create scenes with the props, the animals show expressions of humor, displeasure, happiness, and more depending on the props kids choose. There are also backgrounds that appear to help set the scene, and funny sound effects. Kids can take a photo, if they'd like to save a scene. Swipe the lever for more props, or return to the home page to choose another animal. This app creates zany fun full of emotion and laughter.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[AVOKIDDO EMOTIONS -- PLAYFUL LEARNING FOR KIDS will likely cause giggles and surprises for the youngest and oldest app users alike. There are so many props here, although kids can only choose from batches of five to nine at a time. Kids can choose from ice cream cones, mustaches, balloons, vegetables, hats of all sorts, wigs, musical instruments, sunglasses, bubbles, and more. And it's not limited to one or two props per animal, kids can keep piling them on and playing as long as they'd like. Surprising backgrounds pop up to complete the animal's scene, sometimes with interactive elements, too. As the animals make facial expressions and noises, kids can observe whether the animal likes or dislikes what's happening with the props and in the scene. This fun app creates a silly, delightful, and open-ended way to be creative.]]></csm:any_good>

Though designed for kids with autism in mind, Kid in Story Book Maker could be helpful for parents of preschoolers who want to introduce kids to a routine or ease them into a new experience.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

It's easy to extract a person's image from a photo and eliminate the background, so only the picture of the person can be dropped into the scenes of a book. Parents can create custom books using their own images and words, or they can add their child's image to existing stories (including Faces I Make and Let's Get a Haircut, with more being added regularly). Create unique stories to help kids adapt and grow.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Though many storybook-creation apps exist, Kid in Story Book Maker holds its own, even with a hefty price tag.

A video tutorial shows exactly how to use the tool, which is so easy to manipulate that many kids will quickly be able to create their own stories and insert themselves or their friends into them. Kids can easily share their storybooks, too, even with friends and family who do not buy the app, since there's a free reader available for download. Ways to use Kid in Story Book Maker are limitless, from creating stories to prepare kids for new situations to making memory books of experiences and everything in between. This is a storybook tool that parents and kids will enjoy.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Learn with Homer is a learn-to-read app for kids ages 3 to 6 that incorporates drawing, voice recording, stories, songs, and more, along with more traditional phonics exercises. This app can be helpful for kids who have speech production issues and organization of language issues. A beautiful map on the main page presents all of the options kids can explore: Learn to Read, Story Time; Discover the World, and Homer's Clubhouse. Clear verbal instructions guide kids in all areas. The systematic, sequential phonics program provides kids with lessons, then interactive activities, and a review before moving on to the next level. Within Discover the World, kids can learn about topics ranging from zoos to the five senses. The stories are beautiful, and include many genre-specific sections, like poetry and folk tales. Kids are encouraged throughout the app to draw or voice record their thoughts about everything they're learning. Up to three kids can have individual user accounts on one app, and parents can view progress of each kid aligned with their parent account.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Discover the World and Story Time content also includes free and paid content ($1.99 each or $5.99). You can buy individual lesson or bundles.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Learn with Homer is an outstanding way to get kids excited about all of the amazing things to learn about and enjoy through reading. Reading is the key! Something (and probably many things) on this app will strike a chord of interest with almost any kid. In addition to the excellent systematic phonics lessons here, there's lots of interesting content about things like frogs and world music, fiction, poetry, songs, and a free-drawing feature, so even kids who aren't quite ready to read or haven't been bitten yet by the love-of-reading bug can find something fun.The app also encourages kids to think critically about what they're learning by answering comprehension questions, drawing their ideas based on content-related prompts, and recording answers to general interest questions. The positive feedback ("Hooray and Happy Day!" and "Wiggly ears cheers!") can feel a bit over-the-top after a while. But that's about all to nitpick about this very thoughtful reading app. In many ways, reading is like entering a conversation with life, and Learn With Homer helps kids begin that magical journey.]]></csm:any_good>

It includes the symbols system and voices used in the augmentative and alternative communication app Proloquo2Go. The app benefits kids who have difficulty reading the written word. Picture symbols and voice help kids hear and see text and visuals. There's a new edition for every week of the typical U.S. school year, and it covers current events topics like popular movies, sporting events, holidays, environmental issues, and more. The app is free but each newspaper edition is a $1.99 in-app purchase; an annual subscription is $49.99. Recent editions include main topics like "Endangered Animals," "Edible Schoolyard," and "Mario Brothers." In addition to the articles, you can find recipes, jokes, games, puzzles, related comprehension questions, and more.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[News-2-You brings current events and other newsy tidbits to kids through an easy-to-understand system of symbols and voice recordings, which you can adjust to fit your kid's unique needs. Since many kids love categorizing and organizing, this symbols system provides structure and predictability to words and ideas presented in the news stories. News-2-You may seem pricey, but its content is substantial and fun. Extra extension activities like recipes, jokes (not always easy to explain in terms of symbols, but this app does it), games, discussion questions and more, elevate this weekly news app to a truly one-of-a-kind, accessible, useful resource for kids with special needs, kids who are struggling with reading, and for kids who may not like reading about current events but love symbol systems. Along with Proloquo2Go, it's a powerhouse combo that can help all kids learn about current events, develop comprehension skills, and express themselves.]]></csm:any_good>

The free version is limited to speed tests and one-time samples. Paid content includes single lessons -- such as a crash course, an intermediate, or advanced course.

But these tutorials include high-tech heat maps and fun typing noises that bring interesting sight and sound sensorial elements to what could otherwise be rather dry, tech skills lessons.Because touch screens can be difficult to use when typing a lot of content, the more advanced lessons here aren't always easy or comfortable -- especially for kids or adults who just don't like typing on a touch screen -- but they provide interesting content and lots of progress data to encourage users to keep trying. To get the full use of TapTyping, you'll probably need to buy the full version. If your kid is already a proficient touch-screen typist the free speed tests and one-time sample pages may be enough.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Team Umizoomi Math: Zoom into Numbers HD is an educational math game aimed at toddlers and preschoolers. The app contains five mini-games: Toy Store Counting, Number Bubbles (number recognition), Rolling Toy Parade (number sequencing), Race Around Umi City (number comparisons), and Up! Up! And Balloons (addition/subtraction). Kids must unlock the last four games by completing at least one round of the game before it. When a round of a game is complete, kids earn a reward. After eight rewards in one game, they can earn a trophy. Earning trophies on all five games unlocks the "Key to the City." The city itself also has objects to interact with. The Number Bubbles game has characters chewing bubble gum and blowing bubbles.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[TEAM UMIZOOMI MATH: ZOOM INTO NUMBERS HD has some great features including the ability to have four player profiles, plenty of enthusiastic (if repetitive) feedback, and game objects young kids will relate to (toys, balloons, cars). It may try to pack a bit too much range into the app, however, as a child who needs to learn basic counting will probably not be ready for subtraction. The app also doesn't require any mastery or progress in one game before a child can move along to another one, which may result in kids playing a game that is too difficult. Negative feedback is gentle and, in most games, involves a prompt to choose the right answer, which helps keep kids from being frustrated. This is likely to be a hit with the preschool crowd.]]></csm:any_good>

Notability is a great organizational app giving kids color-coded subject areas. Kids have a choice or handwriting their notes, typing, or recording their notes.  If you set the Accessibility speak feature on the iPad kids can highlight and hear their note and spelling errors.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Just as you would open a notebook and turn to a fresh sheet of notebook paper, NOTABILITY has you open up the app and turn to a blank screen for note taking. From there, you can take notes just as if you were writing in a notebook, but that's not all. For example, if you want to add a photo related to the notes, you can find one online or take a picture right where you are. You can do the same with a Web page, including a screenshot of a particular piece of information you want to remember. If simple text-based notes aren't your thing, you also can record audio notes to go along with text and images or record a teacher during a lecture. Once the notes are complete, they can easily be shared using Dropbox, Google Drive, or another platform, or they can be stored in folders created within the app.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[With Notability, there's no more carrying around bulky notebooks and other note-taking supplies. If kids want to highlight their notes, they can choose from a wide range of colors. Want to add a sticky note with more details? They can do that, too. Every tool kids could possibly need for note taking, including the pencil and paper, exists within the app. If writing notes doesn't appeal to them, they can draw pictures and add voice notes, too. With all these tools, note taking moves from being a rote exercise wherein kids simply copy what the teacher or textbook says to an interactive process wherein kids actually create notes they can use.There's no excuse for losing notes either. Everything is digital and stored within the app. With the ability to create subjects and dividers, kids can organize their notes too. When it comes time to review, they can easily find the relevant notes. If their friends or classmates lose their paper-based notes, kids can share their notes with them through email or even print them out for others to see.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Bugs and Buttons 2 is the sequel to Bugs and Buttons but has different games targeting different skills. The format is the same: six games at three levels, each covering early math, pre-reading, and critical-thinking skills. The beauty of this app is its ability to address fine motor issues in a fun and engaging manner.  Kids can also increase their working memory as they play Music Memory. Math games such as Button Repair address visual spatial issues. The bugs are colorful rather than creepy and are actually quite witty in some mini-games. Bugs and Buttons 2 features easy-to-follow visual instructions, settings hidden behind a parent-only access screen, and amazing, engaging graphics.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In BUGS AND BUTTONS 2, kids can choose a specific game from the available activities or progress through the games automatically. Games cover such skills as counting, letter recognition, matching, sorting, listening, following directions, and developing fine motor skills. Successful gameplay allows kids to earn stamps to add to their "bug" collections, and they can earn special stamps by finding and tapping Morty, the bug guide.  All games make use of adaptive learning technology to keep kids challenged as they play.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Any of the Bugs and Buttons 2 mini-games could probably stand alone as an independent activity, but in this app you get 18 beautifully designed fun and educational games that are well worth the price. The design reflects an understanding of young learners, with easy-to-follow visual instructions, fun graphics and music, and engaging games, all moving at a pace that keeps kids learning. A lot of simple silliness is thrown into the mix as well, such as the ability to find Morty hiding in games or witty quips from the bugs. Educational value is high. In many of the games, kids will develop tech skills and fine motor skills along with critical-thinking, early math, and pre-reading skills. Parents may get a kick out of the obvious classic-arcade-game inspiration for some of the mini-games. The adaptive play easily adjusts to the individual needs of the child. The app not only inspires academic learning, but addresses fine motor skills, working memory, and visual perceptive issues that kids may be struggling with.]]></csm:any_good>

Mini-games get kids observing carefully (with their eyes and their ears), following instructions, and thinking critically. Kids use visual observation skills and critical thinking to complete patterns, find the uncommon object, and match letters. They practice following directions in Puppet Show and develop fine motor and critical-thinking skills in several games reminiscent of classic arcade games. Bugs and Buttons 2 is an engaging and well-rounded preschool learning tool.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Kidspiration Maps is a mind-mapping tool designed specifically for elementary-school-age kids by the creators of Inspiration Maps. The colorful and picture-heavy organizer helps kids learn to organize and classify information to help with writing, reading, and understanding. The app includes a microphone for kids to express their thoughts while creating their diagrams. Using the microphone can help kids with receptive and expressive language issues, giving them the opportunity to practice their language organization and verbal memory. Kids can create graphic organizers such as story maps, Venn diagrams, and webs using the included pictures or their own images. The pictures and graphic organizers can help kids with organizational difficulties. In addition to making graphic organizers the app includes premade activities for reading, writing, social studies, and science. These activities can help kids who are struggling with functional concepts through both visual and written outlines. Outlines can be converted to graphic organizers and vice versa. Kids can share creations by emailing, printing, or saving them to iTunes, Dropbox, Photos, or the app (as PDF or PNG files). The Lite version, which is free, lets kids create up to five mind maps with no sharing options but includes frequent requests to upgrade.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[KIDSPIRATION MAPS is a kid-friendly tool for mind-mapping, a strategy that helps kids organize, learn, and remember information more efficiently. Kids can choose to create a diagram or a SuperGrouper, open a document, or choose a preloaded activity template for reading, writing, social studies, science, or math. To create a diagram (which could be a story map, brainstorming session, or Venn diagram), they start with a white background and a text bubble that can be customized. Kids add text, images, other connecting ideas, and even their own voices. They can toggle back and forth between the outline and graphic views. Using SuperGrouper, kids practice sorting, categorizing, and logically grouping ideas or images or create a picture story using the images provided. Activities are preloaded learning activities that include instructions. These can be used as is or adapted and edited. Projects can be printed, emailed, saved in the app or to Dropbox, or sent to iTunes.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Kidspiration Maps is primarily used in the classroom but can be handy for parents and kids who like to create their own stories and learning activities. This versatile organizational tool comes preloaded with dozens of templates for reading and writing, social studies, science, and math activities. When creating their own maps, kids can be as creative as they want, customizing colors, fonts, shapes, and images. Instructions are text-heavy, and the process of creating a mind map from scratch is not very intuitive, so kids will need some demonstration and explanation. But they should be able to pick it up easily and quickly be able to use it to express their ideas and organize their thoughts. Though pricey, Kidspiration Maps is a worthwhile investment, especially for homeschoolers, because it makes creating prereading and early math activities (or using the dozens of activities already included) really easy. Unlike many educational apps, this one isn't responsive to activities included or created; when kids drag objects into the shape sorter, for example, the app won't tell them if they're correct.]]></csm:any_good>

This app is great for kids have difficulty with abstract concepts like time and direction. Time is even reinforced in the reports at the end of each game, which tell just how much time the game took to complete. In Spanish, todo means all, and Todo Telling Time is a well-rounded, kid-friendly learning game that's all about telling time.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In TODO TELLING TIME, kids play six mini-games related to time, each with multiple difficulty levels. Every aspect of Todo Telling Time puts time right in front of kids, from the start screen with the day's calendar page and current time on digital and analog clocks to the time report after each completed game. In the Days of the Week mini-game, kids order the days of the week, the months of the year, and the dates on a calendar. Ferris Wheel uses the circle of the ride as the face of a clock, and kids put numbered seats in the correct positions, starting with numbers one through 12 and moving up five levels to minutes one through 59. In the Schedule game, kids turn the hands on the clock to the specified time of day for an assigned activity; for example, at 8 a.m., "It's time for the school bus!" The challenge advances to asking kids to set the clock to more abstract times, like two hours past 12:00. Kids work with digital clocks in Train Time, interpret clocks and answer quiz questions in Time Quiz, and combine memory skills with numbers on the face of a clock in Memory. Tapping the triangle at the bottom right of the screen pulls up a grid of all the games and levels, making it easy to go directly to the appropriate challenge. Kids (or parents) can even view a calendar showing a summary of their play for each day.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The developers of Todo Telling Time have taken special care to create a safe, inclusive, and fun learning tool. Repeated exposure to numbers in a circle, as they are on a clock, gives kids a comfort level and confidence with analog clock time in a digital world. Preschoolers can master some of the levels, yet the challenge increases in difficulty enough to reach second and third graders. The quizzes challenge kids to think critically, but some of the times are a bit exaggerated. (Young kids wouldn't spend an hour on homework or in the bathtub, as some questions indicate.) Todo Telling Time, all in all, is a highly effective tool for teaching kids the concepts of time.]]></csm:any_good>

        <csm:what_kids_can_learn><![CDATA[Kids can learn to tell time and understand scheduling and time. One game works on digital-clock time, but most focus on understanding hours and minutes on analog clocks. Kids work on counting by ones and fives and putting numbers in order on a clock face. They'll think about abstract timekeeping concepts like how long activities take, the times of day they're done, and adding and subtracting clock minutes. They'll learn the days of the week and months of the year as well as the layout of a calendar. This complete time resource, addressing concepts from minutes to months, also spans a broad range of levels and abilities.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

Kids can search by keyword or category or simply select a randomly generated image and prompt.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Write About This is versatile and easy to use for kids of many ages. The pictures are engaging and show diversity; the prompts get kids thinking critically and creatively. Kids will enjoy writing and sharing within the app, but for more polished pieces, parents may want to encourage pre-writing and revising, which would happen outside the app.The added voice-recording features are pretty neat, allowing struggling writers to get their ideas out verbally as a pre-writing strategy. Younger kids can practice oral storytelling and expressing their ideas. The developer's website is chockful of other ideas to extend learning, whether at school or at home. This is a must-have app for homeschoolers.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In SENTENCE MAKER, kids view crisp, simple photos of objects (such as a door) or actions (such as a child cooking), which act as the subjects of sentences. Each photo appears on the screen individually along with scattered words that will create a sentence. Gray-scale tiles for each word line the bottom of the screen in sentence order. Kids need to read each scattered word (or tap it and have it read by the narrator) and then place the words in the proper order. If kids don't move the word to its match, the app makes a "boing" sound, and the word won't fit into that spot. Once all words are matched, the narrator speaks the entire sentence so kids can hear how it flows.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Sentence Maker provides a direct, visual, and adaptable way for kids to practice word pairing and sentence making. The real-life images of actions and objects are pleasant and easy for kids to relate to, and the letter-tile and word-grouping format is simple to understand. Although the images do a fair job of including people of both genders as well as of different ages and races, a broader diversity of pictures would increase the app's relatability. Users can add their own images in the paid version.With settings that can be customized to suit a child's current needs (including using only word pairs, giving hints, or deleting or adding specific images and sentences), Sentence Maker has the potential to elevate kids' understanding of and comfort level with sentence structure in a low-stress way.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[TODO K-2 MATH PRACTICE takes kids through six different mini-games over three grade levels (kindergarten, first grade, and second grade) of Common Core State Standards for math skills. Kids can choose to practice in timed sessions of six, eight, or 10 minutes, or play free choice by choosing their practice games. Each game offers simple verbal and visual instructions and gives kids concrete ways to understand abstract math concepts. Kids use manipulatives like shapes, cookies, or counters to solve math problems. Accomodating kids with differing levels of fine motor skills, the game allows kids to drag and drop the answers into place or write them with a finger or stylus.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The developers of Todo K-2 Math Practice have taken special care to create a math tool that is safe for kids, inclusive of different learning abilities, and aligned to math educational standards and best practices. The games are straightforward math practice, and would be ideal for helping kids complete a few minutes of daily math practice. The drag-and-drop or write-in-your answer options can be tricky at first. Kids have to touch and hold the number to drag it into place, and some traced numbers, if written messily, are not correctly recognized. All in all, there's no gimmick here, just solid math practice with encouraging, supportive feedback.]]></csm:any_good>

Routines covered include getting ready for school in the morning and getting ready for bed at night. Kids are asked to do tasks that are likely to apply to most families: getting dressed, eating breakfast, brushing teeth, and taking a bath. This app is a good early introduction for kids who may have problems with organization and paying attention to their daily routines. It may also be helpful for kids who have social issues and need a structured way to begin their day. There's also a five-minute-timer tool that can play a tooth-brushing song.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[It's morning time, and Daniel Tiger needs to get ready for school. Help him wake up and listen to a song about the tasks he needs to do. Then help him get ready: get dressed, eat breakfast, brush his teeth, and put on his shoes. Later, it's nighttime and Daniel Tiger needs to get ready for bed. Help him take a bath, brush his teeth, put on his PJs, read a book, and go to sleep. As kids play, each task has an interactive component, and some have imaginative extras (kids can watch a pancake dance or color Daniel's pajamas).]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Daniel Tiger is impossibly cute, and his parents are gentle and loving as they guide him through preparations for school and bed. He's a great role model for many youngsters. Indeed, kids likely will be drawn to finding out what Daniel Tiger does in his house and compare it to their own routines.Though the song about getting ready stresses that there's an order to things (and rightly so: you generally eat breakfast before brushing your teeth), kids can do the tasks in any order they want. They can also get Daniel to school without completing all the tasks (like getting dressed). This could prove a bit misleading for some kids and may prompt discussion. Also, the routine doesn't cover everything a kid might do. For instance, Daniel Tiger doesn't have to go potty (or get a diaper change). The five-minute-timer function can be uniquely helpful for brushing teeth when it's set for two minutes, using the tooth-brushing song option.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids also can learn that the main parts of their daily routines are pretty universal. For example, just about everyone eats breakfast and brushes their teeth in the morning. Also, the app gives kids a fun way to make sure they brush their teeth for a whole two minutes, as recommended by the American Dental Association. Daniel Tiger's Day and Night is an engaging way for kids to learn beginning- and end-of-the-day routines, but it misses out on the time in-between.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that iTrace - handwriting for kids is an early handwriting skills practice app that includes letters, numbers, words, and a special mode that focuses practice on the user's name. The app shows a realistic hand holding a pencil that shows kids exactly where to trace on the model letter or number. It also erases incorrect tracing back to the previous step. This app is particularly helpful for kids who have difficulty with differentiating letter spacing and fine motor issues. It includes a detailed progress report for parents that gives images of each tracing as well as assessments, such as "too shaky," "out of bounds," and "overextended." Each letter includes a default version and an alternate version for different styles and preferences (including one for lefties). Fun rewards include seek-and-finds and cute animated scenes.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Read through the tutorial, set up a player account, and adapt the settings to letter style and left- or right-hand preference. Choose uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, name practice, or words. Watch the hand trace the letter, listen to the letter name spoken, and then trace. Dots and lines show you where to trace. After tracing a letter three times, kids get a reward. In name mode, kids choose colors for tracing their names. In words mode, kids see animated items appear in the scene after each word they trace correctly.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Overall, ITRACE - HANDWRITING FOR KIDS provides lots of good tracing exercises to help kids get familiar with letter formation. The ability to customize letters to left- or right-handed tracing as well as to different writing styles is especially impressive. As kids progress, the app selects the next appropriate exercise automatically. The My Name module allows kids to practice writing their own names in many color combinations -- sure to be a favorite choice for many kids.On the downside, once a word appears the letters enlarge so parts of the word often confusingly fall off the right side of the screen. There are some odd word choices in the word-tracing mode that young kids aren't likely to be familiar with or use, such as "yacht" and "stilts," although you can add your own words. Also, the app says only the name of the letter and doesn't sound it out. Some terms used in the assessment ("too shaky," "out of bounds," and "overextended") may be descriptive but not necessarily helpful to say to kids trying to master that letter. If young users stick with letters, numbers, and kids' names for a while and modify assessments for older tracers, they can avoid the pitfalls and enjoy iTrace's strengths.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[The desktop software version of Inspiration has been used in classrooms for a decade. Kids can create visual representations using shapes, clouds, imported images, colors, and text. INSPIRATION MAPS on iPad puts the software in kids' hands, where they can use touch-screen gestures to create their maps and share them by emailing, printing, saving, or exporting them to the desktop or Web versions of Inspiration. Kids can create text outlines and convert them to diagrams or start with a visual mind-map and convert it to a text outline. Dozens of templates are included to get kids started organizing ideas for writing assignments, planning speeches or essays, thinking through groups projects, and more.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Mind-mapping is a strategy that helps kids learn and remember information more efficiently. Inspiration Maps makes it easy for kids to brainstorm, plan, think, and remember information. They can be as creative as they want in organizing their ideas. The iPad version works beautifully, with tap-and-swipe gestures to create the parts of the map. Background and object colors, text sizes and fonts, and images all are customizable. Work can be saved and reopened easily to continue editing. Sharing is easy, too. Kids can print their maps, adding a professional look to a presentation or report. The free version, Inspiration Maps Lite, allows the creation of up to five mind maps, but it doesn't offer sharing.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids who may be dysgraphic and need the additional guidance will benefit from the the hand and finger exercises to help develop handwriting readiness. Throughout three games kids use three touches -- tap, tap-and-drag, and pinch -- to interact with fun, lively pictures. Kids or parents can choose the appropriate starting difficulty, and the levels increase automatically as kids play. Progress reports allow parents to track kids' scores. If the sound effects or background music grow tiresome, parents or kids can easily turn them off. Unless parents disable the iPad's camera, it takes a fun, carnival-distorted picture at the end of each Trace and Erase game. The pictures don't seem to be saved or recorded.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids "Tap Squashes" until they're squished, "Pinch Peppers" to make them pop, or "Trace and Erase" lines that follow a particular pattern. They can choose their starting difficulty level, which automatically levels up as they play. Kids' performance is recorded in a few ways: levels completed, completion time, and accuracy (or number of peppers pinched/squashes squished). Performance data can be shared via email, although this option is protected by a wall. Performance can help provide parents with their child's handwriting readiness. Keeping a running record of progress helps parents share their child's progress with teachers and/or Occupational Therapist. Parents buy an in-app purchase to create multiple accounts so more than one kid can record scores.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[DEXTERIA JR. has a cute, appealing design. Though gameplay is relatively simple and game options are limited, kids likely will enjoy squishing the squash or popping the peppers as fast as they can. The tracking feature provides useful information that can help parents see how their kids' accuracy and speed are improving over time. However, it would be nice to see some help for parents who want to interpret this data.Kids will definitely get lots of practice with fine motor movements using their fingers. However, as a tablet app, Dexteria Jr. raises an important question: Is this kind of flat-screen practice actually transferrable to the 3-D, physical world? Will pinching a pepper on the screen really prepare kids to hold a pencil? The tracing activity seems to be the most promising -- if, perhaps, the least engaging -- as it mimics letter-tracing workbooks and skills that may be more readily transferred beyond the screen.]]></csm:any_good>

Audio and visual prompts show kids exactly where to trace from the start of the letter to the finish. The bright, animated graphics that accompany each tracing page are eye-catching and rewarding. Parents can use the multiple settings to adjust letter size, show or hide the letter model, and create their own words. This is a great app for kids who struggle with handwriting and visual spatial relations. It also benefits kids who need to hear the phonetic spelling of a word. There's also an optional five-star progressive tracing system that requires the user to trace each letter five times, increasing in difficulty. Detailed reports show parents how each kid is progressing.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Writing Wizard - Kids Learn to Write Letters &amp; Words is an engaging writing-practice tool for beginners.

Animated graphics -- from dancing cupcakes to rushing rainbows of stars, tiger faces, and bouncing hearts -- motivate kids to keep following the audio and visual prompts to trace each letter, number, and word properly to see what happens in the end. They also can play with the animations by swiping, tapping, or tilting the iPad.The customization options help parents tailor the experience to a kid's current level and increase difficulty for more precision in tracing as they improve. Although the app doesn't directly evolve to include concrete writing skills such as using a pincer grip or holding a writing tool, tracing is an important beginning step. Writing Wizard provides well-designed, thoughtfully created tracing practice that includes some letter naming and phonetic sounds.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids can practice tracing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and words and can even create their own list words. As kids trace, they also hear each letter's name and its phonetic pronunciation. Kids can improve fine motor skills and practice following visual directions as they watch and follow the hand, dots, and arrows that guide them along the correct tracing path. Finally, kids can see how focused effort pays off when the fun and interactive visual rewards appear.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Tic Toc Time helps kids learn to read analog clocks through a series of discoveries about the passing of time. Graphics benefit kids who have trouble the order of numbers. It is also helpful for kids who have difficulty understanding numbers as concepts. Kids can learn about using a compass, following the sun and shadows, Earth's rotation, and reading a clock. Kids will hear about some time-related vocabulary like "midnight," "quarter till," and "quarter past." In games using the compass, kids will need to stand up and perhaps turn around to align their device with the appropriate cardinal direction. As a reward, kids earn items for a virtual garden (seeds, water, sunlight) when they complete tasks, and can tend to their garden at any time. Parents can set up multiple accounts for different kids, and, although they can include personal information in kids' profiles, they're not required to.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[A cute family of Canadian beavers teach kids how to tell time through a series of interactive explorations about the sun, shadows, and clocks. Kids first learn about cardinal directions, how the sun's position in the sky changes, and how we can use shadows to estimate the time. Then kids build a clock and explore the meaning of the numbers, the big hand and little hand, and some time-related vocabulary. Kids earn supplies to plant and cultivate a garden as they progress through the levels.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The games in TIC TOC TIME follow a sequence; some of the games, though perhaps not all, may be fun enough to draw kids back for more. The games that explore the sun's position in the sky and the resulting shadows are the best in a number of ways. Using a compass to discover the cardinal directions and, subsequently, the length and position of shadows is a really creative way to introduce kids to the concept of Earth's rotation as it relates to time telling. There's also a brief explanation that connects these games to how clocks are made. These are interesting and concrete ways to help kids conceptualize abstract ideas that affect them every day. While the clock-based games are more straightforward, they have fewer in-game supports for finding correct answers, and include some vocabulary that might be a bit much for younger kids. The short explanation of the big hand and little hand might work for older kids, but may confuse the younger set. A lot of kids get confused about the differences between telling time on digital and analog clocks, and the the app would do well to include more support with this. Nevertheless, Tic Toc Time is a good resource for helping kids understand the concepts behind why we tell time the way we do.]]></csm:any_good>

The first set of games -- involving the sun and shadows -- is stronger and does a nice job supporting the concept of how we tell time.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[SENTENCEBUILDER FOR IPAD uses games to guide kids through the sentence-creation process. After setting up an account, kids can choose the level at which they'd like to start. They also can choose the module they'd like to play and how often they want to view animations. Parents can create and manage multiple accounts within the app.During the game, kids see a picture and a word-selector tool, which they use to choose the words to describe what they see. There are correct and incorrect combinations, and kids move the selectors to form a grammatically correct sentence. Details play an important role. For example, if a clown is juggling three balls, the sentence "the clown is juggling four balls" won't fly. Stats track the number of sentences attempted, as well as the number of correct sentences on the first, second, and third attempts. However, the app doesn't measure success with specific parts of speech or grammatical concepts like subject-verb agreement.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SentenceBuilder for iPad can be a valuable way to help emerging readers and writers learn to create grammatically correct sentences. Also, although the app won't teach it directly, kids can pick up some of the important grammar skills that people tend to pick up more implicitly, simply through reading and using language. Often, reading and conversing with others are the best ways for kids to glean these skills. However, where books and conversations don't always give feedback on mistakes, SentenceBuilder for iPad can help support kids as they learn the thought process behind sentence-building.Unfortunately, the design lacks a bit of polish and pizzazz. Pictures designed to accompany the sentences resemble low-quality clip art. Also, some cheesy animations designed to motivate kids have no relevance to the sentences and seem a bit haphazardly placed.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[PICTELLO is an interactive storytelling app that allows kids and their parents to make virtual storybooks with their own titles, photos, and captions. It should have appeal for all kids and parents, but it also should be especially useful for kids who have difficulty understanding social cues, reading facial expressions, and interpreting body language. A simple step-by-step tutorial guides users through the process of creating stories on their own. Different options for how text and pictures are read or uploaded support different types of learners. For example, the voice quality, rate, and pronunciation can be modified; audio can be created using text-to-speech, recording one's own voice, or selecting a computerized voice; and text can be highlighted as it's read. A library of sample stories, although small, can help fuel the creative process. Note that stories within the library show kids who have learning difficulties and special needs as well as ones who don't.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[What better way for kids to feel empowered than by relating their own stories? Sure, the interface is a bit spare and the number of examples is thin. But the tutorial is clear, there are solid audio and visual supports, and it can be a fabulously fun way for parents and kids together to address the ups and downs of communication, friendship, and the daily grind. Pictello may be pricey, but it's a high-quality product that most families will make great use of.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[RAINBOW SENTENCES is an individualized sentence-building app to help kids with their grammar, expressive language, reading, and comprehension. First, parents need to set up a user account choosing levels and the ability to record audio and to color code sentences, among other things. Each level provides a pictograph to give a visual hint helping kids organize the given words into a grammatically correct sentence. For kids who have difficulty with their expressive and receptive language skills, they can record their sentence upon completion of the task. Sentences can be saved or emailed to track progress. As kids master simple sentences, they can proceed to more complex sentences with or without color-coding. Parents can manage their child's account and track their progress.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Rainbow Sentences is an intuitive app with many accommodations for kids with learning difficulties. It offers kids a multisensory approach with room to grow as they achieve mastery. Using pictographs helps kids who need visual cues when trying to put together a group of words. Using color coding is especially helpful for kids who have difficulty with determining word order. Kids who are new to the app will need some guidance to get started. Graphics could be more appealing, as they appear too simple and childish when used with older kids who may still need assistance making sentences. As the levels become more difficult, it would be nice to see sentences that relate to the real world to help kids with their social skills.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that StoryPals is a reading-comprehension app that lets kids create their own stories. There are 24 short stories that target kids on reading levels from grade 2 to 6. Kids can hear the stories read to them or read them themselves. In the basic version, there is no text-to-speech or highlighting as the story is read, but digitized speech can be recorded. The included stories' characters are animals and cartoons, and the illustrations are animated when activated. Each story has a quiz attached; you can assign and track responses for up to six kids. Questions center on who, what, where, when, and why, and scores list how many correct answers users have out of a total and give a percentage. Scores also display dates so you can track progress over time. You can also create your own stories and quizzes with the backgrounds and characters provided or with your own images.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids can read short stories with picture illustrations that are animated when activated, or have the stories read to them. In the basic version, digitized text (recorded by a story creator) is read aloud; the full version also has text-to-speech and word highlighting as it's read. Kids then take a multiple-choice quiz to determine comprehension. The included stories target second- to sixth-grade readability levels. Parents and kids also can write their own stories with provided backgrounds and characters or use their own pictures.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[STORYPALS is a good app for supporting kids as they learn reading comprehension and how to respond to "wh" questions, which fosters a deeper understanding of content. But, with only 24 stories, ultimately kids will memorize them and the quizzes will become invalid. The ability to create your own stories is a nice feature, but it can be time-consuming. Both app options seem a bit pricey for the limited number of stories offered.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[VIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES is a solid math app with a focused purpose: to help learners visually understand the relationships among percentages, fractions, and decimals. Kids who use fraction bars/tiles at school will probably know what to do with the app and may find it to be a great homework helper. Otherwise, you'll need to explain the how and why for using this tool before kids will get much out of it. This is where the app falls short: It doesn't offer any guidance to parents on how to use the app with their kids.But if you're able to meet that challenge, Virtual Manipulatives can make a tough concept a bit more easy to understand for kids with a variety of learning styles, with visual representations that kids can use their hands to manipulate. It's colorful, well designed, and free, making it a good addition to your math apps collection.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Zones of Regulation is based on the book and curriculum Zones of Regulation by Leah Kuypers and is designed to support kids and adults who struggle with social and emotional control. It presents situations and circumstances and helps kids understand and define their feelings and consider their behavior options and strategies for maintaining appropriate behavior. As the questions progress, it can support the development of strategies for self-regulation in the game and hopefully be generalized for real life. Kids need to be competent readers to play the app independently, and it's recommended the app be used in conjunction with the book and curriculum of the same name.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SOGABEE'S MATH FACTS FUN gives young kids a successful experience while they practice arithmetic. Kids like the simple yet appealing graphics, and the levels let them practice math facts in incremental progressions. Kids unlock levels as they go, which will help keep them interested, and they can see their progress as their characters are filled in. They also can track mistakes at the top of the screen, where three ducks get crossed out one at a time with errors. If kids make three mistakes, their character cries, but they can go back and try the level again. If they're successful, the character cheers. You can customize play for more of a challenge; kids can choose to use all four operations and choose which number of facts to review. SoGaBee's Math Facts Fun also tracks mistakes, which can be found in Tricky Problems. Kids can choose that section and repeat all the problems they missed.This engaging app would be best enjoyed by young kids who are practicing their basic arithmetic facts. This is a mainstream app that would be suitable for kids with disabilities who can use a touchscreen but would not work for kids who are blind or who access technology with a single switch.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that SoundNote is a productivity app that syncs recorded audio with the notes taken during the recording. It's a tool parents might appreciate themselves for work or study and that teens will find handy in lecture-based courses. Notes and audio can be shared by email or accessed by URL on other devices on the same network. The app is great for kids who are easily distracted or who may not understand something a teacher has said during a lesson. Kids can go back to their recorded notes and listen to the lesson again to help reinforce missed facts or facts that need reinforcement. Students also can add drawings to their notes to help them remember what the teacher has said.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[SOUNDNOTE doesn't include any written instructions or even a start screen. It opens right up into a blank page for note-taking. Teens title their note page, hit the red record button, and begin typing notes or select the pen tool to draw or write notes. While the speaker is talking, teens take notes and the device records the audio. Teens simply hit pause when done, and the notes save automatically with the title. When replaying the audio, teens can tap a word on their notes and the audio will automatically jump to the place when that note was written. Teens can share their notes and audio by email, save them to Dropbox, or access them via another device on the network through a URL. To listen to the audio on a Mac computer, teens will need to download a free SoundNote reader.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SoundNote is a tool that showcases how cool technology can be. It records a lecture and knows which notes were written down at each point in that lecture, making it easy to review the notes and listen to specific parts of the lecture. The sparse design keeps the focus on the meat of the app: recording audio and taking notes. The search function for the saved documents makes it easy to find notes, even when many have been saved. Teens can easily share class notes with classmates over email. The audio picks up well from across a room, though it's not the quality of a professional recording.]]></csm:any_good>

They can record class discussions or lectures while taking notes and easily refer back to specific points in the audio recording for clarification or to get verbatim quotes. Students can use it in many subject areas -- recording lectures in science, history, or other lecture-based courses. The drawing tool is handy for recording explanations in math class while copying example equations. Teens can record small group discussions while taking notes. They can record interviews for written pieces. SoundNote is an easy-to-use yet powerful tool for note-taking.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

It connects with Google Drive, Evernote, and Dropbox accounts to access saved files and can pull text from websites through an in-app browser. It works with Instapaper and Pocket to read entries, and it accesses free ebooks through Project Gutenberg and Bookshare. Kids can set the appearance of the documents, customizing the font. They can change the reading speed, bookmark and highlight within the text, and edit the text within the app. Kids can advance or rewind within the texts, as well, customizing the length of each advance (15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds, one sentence, one paragraph, one chapter, etc.). They can export their highlighted portions or the entire text. The app comes preloaded with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a welcome document explaining the features, and a help document that serves as a how-to.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Voice Dream Reader is a must-have tool for kids who have difficulty processing visual text, and it's really handy for anyone who wants to have text read aloud sometimes. It's pretty easy to use, and it's nice that the instructions serve as a model for how the app works -- with the Voice Dream Reader reading them aloud. The voice quality on the included voices is decent, but the in-app-purchase voices are much better quality and more natural sounding. The app does import text from websites as best it can, excluding ads, but the read-aloud on websites is a bit clunky. Overall, it's an impressive tool, especially for reading documents and epub books.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that QuestionIt is a quality educational app designed to help people with autism and language issues develop and strengthen concepts of language. It provides experience in sorting and answering "wh" questions by systematically teaching which types of words answer which types of questions. It reinforces with a built-in, color-coded cueing system that can be faded as skills improve. QuestionIt includes a data manager to record the types of questions and percentage correct for each one. The content and vocabulary are good but not always motivating. It's notable in providing errorless questions, wherein only one answer is accepted and kids are moved on to the next question. It reinforces kids with intermittent fireworks.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Jake's Never Land Pirate School includes four games -- Sailing, Pirate Band, Map &amp; Spyglass, and Pixie Dust Class -- that kids who are fans of the Disney show of the same name will likely find festive, fun, and just challenging enough to hold their attention. In Sailing Class, kids tilt the mobile device to navigate their ship around buoys and practice colors. In others, they trace pixie dust to form shapes; tap out raucous pirate drum beats, use a spyglass to discover treasure, and more. Your kid gets to become the most adorable part of the app when you take his or her photo and size it in the app to fit the cartoon pirate body on the app.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Games include basic preschool and kindergarten skills such as tracing and naming shapes, counting, and following directions. There's just enough challenge on this game to keep young kids interested and let parents know they're learning something. It's also nice to see the option of a boy or girl pirate character for equal opportunity employment in Jake's version of harmless piracy.]]></csm:any_good>

The games target pre- or early readers. One game, Pixie Dust Class, combines pre-writing tracing skills with shape identification by asking kids to trace the pixie dust on the screen through a maze that includes a shape made of pixie dust. The number games help kids practice counting into the teens; if the app had some addition or subtraction practice it would offer more challenge for kids who have already mastered basic counting.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In ITOUCHILEARN LIFE SKILLS: MORNING ROUTINES FOR PRESCHOOL KIDS, kids go through a series of short scenarios. First they watch a child demonstrate an action like getting dressed or eating breakfast. A song accompanies each scene to the tune of "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" with lyrics related to the activity. Then the scene repeats, allowing kids to take part in the action by tapping on relevant objects like the brush or milk. Extra activities include a jigsaw puzzle and music mode, which shows each scene with song lyrics.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[iTouchiLearn Life Skills: Morning Routines for Preschool Kids does a good job of showing kids what needs to get done each morning, especially if they need to get to school on time. The interactive elements are simple, but can help kids remember the essential things needed for each step, like the toothbrush for brushing teeth or using your hands to wash your face. The song is easy to learn, and even parents may find themselves singing it to keep their kids moving along in the morning.As for improvements, it would be nice if the app had ways for kids to track completion of their own daily routines with something like a printable or in-app chart. In addition, the app could reflect more diversity among the characters in the animations.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that with Math Vs Zombies, kids can practice math skills from basic operations through multi-digit multiplication and division in a series of entertaining worlds. Starting with simple math at the easy level, the approach of zombie cartoon characters on the screen lends a sense of anticipation and excitement that may encourage kids to practice math facts and computation in an electronic format. The difficulty levels make this game appealing to kids from first grade through sixth, as basic facts at the easy levels are taken to multiple-digit problems, including regrouping at the hard level. The app is accessible by nonreaders and intuitive to play. Kids with low vision will find it difficult to see math problems on the screen, especially on smartphones or iPods.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

When zombies appear (with creepy music), players solve each zombie's math problem by choosing a number on the touchscreen and then zapping that zombie with a lightning bolt. In the seventh game at each level, the zombies each carry four math problems that have to be solved to complete the game. Winning each level unlocks the next. You can repeat levels as many times as you want. The creepy/cute characters and the ominous music add an appeal to a game that's essentially a fun way to practice math.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[MATH VS ZOMBIES is a fun way to reinforce learning with practice in a format that appeals to kids. The cartoon graphics and music add to the entertainment factor. It's easy to use, and the draw of zombies is attractively mainstream. Kids may stay on task longer because it's fun to zap the zombies. Kids with basic addition skills all the way up to older kids will be challenged at one of the three  levels.Each level has a time limit, which will be exciting for some kids but stressful for others. Incorrect answers make the control panel flash red. If the time limit runs down, kids can restart the level and try again. As long as they're not intimidated by the time constraints of this app, it could be a fun way to practice math skills either alone or with friends or family members.]]></csm:any_good>

They won't find flashy graphics, cool sound effects, or even creative games; instead, the Greek/Latin roots take center stage.

Flashcards cover four main categories: prefixes, suffixes, Greek roots, and Latin roots. As teens study flashcards, they earn experience points. Completing timed drills, organized by subject and level, also earns points. Both types of points help determine a teen's overall GPA and grade level, shown on the Report Card.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[With Vocab Rootology, developer PrepInteractive aims to help teens prepare for important standardized tests, such as the ACT, SAT, and GRE. This focus on academic success leads to a more serious app focused less on frills and more on academic vocabulary. Multiple levels keep teens from practicing the same words over and over again, and the report card feature encourages them to improve their GPAs as they continue building their knowledge of Greek and Latin roots.An engaging tutorial instead of lengthy instructions would give the app a boost, as would audio options for auditory learners.]]></csm:any_good>

Flashcards allow them to build their knowledge, checking off roots one at a time as they correctly define them.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Kids who enjoy predictability and who already know the value of coins may find AMAZING COIN engaging. But a big drawback of this app is that it's difficult for kids to distinguish quarters and nickels (and even half dollars) because they appear to be the same size. Adding controls that let kids choose levels could improve the experience. Amazing Coin covers such a wide range that it will baffle young kids who don't know how to count money yet and frustrate older kids who are ready to practice counting money and making change but don't need to follow patterns or spell coin names.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that kids learning about coins can increase their independence while playing Jungle Coins. Kids learn to differentiate coins, count money, compare coins, and give correct change. Sound is available for kids who benefit from listening to directions and hearing coin amounts. Each activity has five predetermined levels. Level 6 allows you to enter specific coins to help a child who may have learning difficulties. Level 6 also allows you to omit the half-dollar and dollar coins, which can be confusing to kids unfamiliar with them. Parents can track their child's history in the settings area. The history gives the date, number of attempts, and time spent on each activity.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Choose your coin level, and practice how to find coins, give correct change, count money, and compare coin amounts. Kids can flip their coins to hear the values and see the front and back of a coin. For correct answers, the chosen animal gives a happy face. JUNGLE COINS is especially beneficial for kids who may be struggling with coin differentiation. Kids also are presented with "realistic" one-step word problems. Many kids who struggle with the abstract concept of coins will benefit from using the voice setting to hear the word problem.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Jungle Coins has tremendous flexibility for kids just learning about coins and for kids with learning difficulties. The ability to have sound to hear questions and coin amounts helps reinforce how much a coin is worth. When the app begins, the coins sound like they're being emptied from a pocket, giving the experience a realistic feel. The coins look real (although the nickel and penny have not been updated to the newest coins). With five levels of play, the app encourages kids to look forward to moving to the next level. Level 6 is a nice addition to help decrease frustration, as parents can set the coins used in the child's real world. The app is multilingual, making it adaptable for ELL learners. Parents also can monitor their kid's progress by referring to their child's history. It would be nice if the app had a scratch pad or calculator to help kids who have difficulty adding coins mentally.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that The Social Express is an excellent, animated app for boosting kids' social-awareness skills. Each lesson presents daily interactive social situations using video modeling, "hidden rules," and suggestions for how to problem-solve in daily life. The two levels of play are differentiated with basic cues for beginners and more social situations for intermediate users. Parents should note that kids have the option to participate in The Social Express' private social network, where they can reveal their real names and hometowns. We don't recommend allowing kids to reveal this kind of personal information.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Kids help each character resolve social situations at locations around town including a cafe, a fire station, a music store, and a park.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[THE SOCIAL EXPRESS does a fantastic job of offering kids a natural way to understand and practice key social cues and skills that are needed for success in life. The app uses beautiful visuals and animation to present realistic day-to-day social scenarios. Each lesson offers kids the chance to make decisions about the choices the characters make, and kids can try again if they respond incorrectly. Repeating the lessons can help increase a child's social awareness. Printables allow kids to have a tangible reminder about coping strategies, feelings, and more; kids can carry these with them or post them on a wall.Part of what makes the app shine is the guidance it gives parents, from the guide for parents (available on the Social Express website) to the "teaching tips" that appear during a lesson (tips can be turned off for kids using the app independently). There are not many downsides to the app, but the Clubhouse social network raises privacy concerns because kids can reveal personal information. It's optional, though, so parents can simply choose not to allow kids to participate until the privacy issues are corrected, and kids can enjoy learning with the other parts of this fabulous app.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The simple picture drawings in That's How I Feel are sometimes very clear and other times a bit too complex or nuanced for many young kids to understand. For example, the drawing for the emotion "ashamed" shows a stick figure scratching his head with a circle containing the words "work" and "money" next to him. The one for "depressed" displays a boy with two broken hearts to his sides and tears on his face. In some instances such as these, parents may need to help kids identify which drawing correlates to how they're feeling by explaining the drawings or giving them more options. The three main categories will likely be fairly easy for kids to understand, which can help them narrow their choices. And the app's simple design makes it easy to navigate and use.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[HIDDEN CURRICULUM FOR KIDS is a good education app to help people on the autism spectrum learn important social cues. It explains how to maneuver through common social situations by offering kids, their parents, families, peers, teachers, and other professionals tips to spur conversations about successful social interactions. It can also help people from other cultures, or those recuperating from brain traumas, learn social norms and expectations.The app falls short, however, on two key fronts. First, it's text based and lacks an option to have the text spoken aloud. Instead, it requires kids to either have solid reading skill or an adult to read to them. Second, there's no ability for kids or adults to make custom situation flash cards tailored to their individual needs, which potentially leaves important social skills unaddressed.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[LOOK IN MY EYES 1 RESTAURANT is one of those apps that will likely work well for some kids, but others may not relate to it at all. The concept is simple and seems like it would be effective, but it depends on how kids take to the game and whether they enjoy the rewards. For kids who like the app, the learning value will come with consistent practice both on and off screen. For kids who don't connect to the game, perhaps a different version of the app would catch their interest (other versions include dinosaurs, undersea, steam train, mechanic, and more).]]></csm:any_good>

Kids can gain cultural awareness on the importance of eye contact, although it would be nice to see more diversity in the faces that appear on the app. In addition to eye contact, kids get some practice in number recognition and addition and subtraction by earning $2 in game currency for each correct response and spending that money on their virtual restaurant. Look In My Eyes 1 Restaurant can help kids practice making eye contact, but it's unclear whether on-screen practice will translate to real life.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

An "About Writer" doc opens with a list of features and recent updates. The plus symbol opens a blank document, which automatically saves as users type. In the documents menu, users can link these files to their Dropbox account.

Sharing options include email, print, Google Drive, Evernote, or Dropbox.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[IAWRITER fills a particular niche in the pool of productivity apps. It's a straightforward text editor with basic functionality and invaluable sharing features. There's no WYSIWYG editor with options to customize fonts or insert images and hyperlinks into your document. Users type, then save or share. Dropbox and Evernote integrate with a tap of the finger, and iCloud syncing makes docs available on all devices in real time (though some users noted problems setting up iCloud). iA Writer is also available on Mac laptops and desktops, though users must purchase the Mac version of the app in addition to the mobile version to sync docs to their computers.iA Writer may not have the formatting options of products like Pages or Microsoft Office, but its simplicity makes writing the focal point. With kids, this uncluttered, easy-to-use app might be a great tool to practice typing or simply focus on the written word.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[With just four dishes, MYPLAY CHEF LITE is not a particularly filling app. But nabbing the free version for a long wait at the post office isn't a bad idea. Sitting with kids and talking them through the steps may make the experience a bit more educational. The app developers could have helped you along by labeling all the ingredients and kitchen equipment and the steps in big letters and including talk of measurements, cooking times, and temperatures. For the cupcakes it looks like you add two cups of baking powder -- yikes.Still, there are some fun interactive moments that keep kids engaged: stirring batter, flipping a pancake, and tapping oodles of meatballs on top of spaghetti.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that News-O-Matic is an interactive, paid subscription-based newspaper for kids ages 7-10. Five news stories -- from world political news to celebrity stories -- are posted on the News-O-Matic app's main page each day. Stories are written by experts, and a child psychologist reviews the articles. There are more than 15 different features on this newsy app, including the stories, puzzles, a word game, and audio. The "Read to Me" feature is beneficial for kids who have auditory processing issues or difficulty with verbal reasoning. The map feature displays the distance from a kid's home to the location of a news story (if the user allows the app to access location), along with a silly distance tracker, like the number of pope hats it takes to get from your home to Vatican City for a story on the Catholic Church.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Consumerism" rating="2"><![CDATA[At the time of this review, subscription prices were $1.99 per daily issue, $6.99 a week, or $49.99 per year. There are no in-app purchases (other than the subscriptions) and no ads. Subscriptions renew automatically unless you go into your iTunes account and change subscription settings to not renew. Some of the news stories focus on product brands, such as DC Comics super heroes (there's a writing contest sponsored by DC Comics); for-profit organizations; or publicity events, like the MTV Movie Awards.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

The main screen lays out a few main headlines for the day in blocks with photos, so kids can choose one that looks and sounds interesting to them. The "Read to Me" feature reads news stories aloud to kids. Kids can tap on vocabulary words in the article to learn their meanings, as well as tap on "Fact" to learn a basic fact presented in the article, or "Act" to read an extension question or activity related to the article. Tap "Go There" to view a map of where the topic of the article occurred. The two extra games are easy to play, too.]]></csm:content_grid_item>
        <csm:content_grid_item name="Privacy &amp; safety" rating="4"><![CDATA[Press4Kids, News-O-Matic's developer, asks for a kid's first name, birthday, and location during the subscription process, but the information is not required. A kid's name and chosen image (a photo or cute animal pic) appears on the app's main screen ("Hi, Emily") when he or she opens the app. The News Room feature allows kids to write or draw an image to the editor-in-chief; some of these submissions are posted on the app with the kid's first name and age. Kids must have a parent or guardian's permission before subscribing, and the subscription requires an in-app purchase. The app asks users to allow a kid's location for the map feature. The app is COPPA compliant, and indicates in its terms that it does not disclose kids' information to other sources.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Open the app to view the front page of NEWS-O-MATIC, which includes five top stories of the day with colorful pictures, as well as the games (Puzzle Picture or Mystery Word), news timeline quiz, News Room (interact with the editor), and information features. Tap on a story and the written content appears, with more photos and interactive content. There are many interactive options on each news article's page: Fact, Act, Map, find out about the author, write or draw something, and more. In all, more than 15 options for kids in this newsy app.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[News-O-Matic is an excellent news source for kids at home or in the classroom and well worth the subscription fee -- if your kid will read the five daily stories and delve into the interactive content consistently. For kids who like news, this app is a sure winner. Kids can read about real-world news (or have it read aloud to them by the app's "Read to Me" feature), such as politics and news of the economy, as well as stories with lighter topics like entertainment, celebrities, or sports. You may want to consider trying a few issues before signing up for a longer-term subscription to get a feel for whether the typical range of topics appeals to your kid.News-O-Matic exposes kids to topics of all kinds, and it tries to include ways to get kids interacting with stories (maps, questions, games, write-the-editor features) far beyond the typical end-of-article multiple-choice quiz on other similar news-for-kids products. With teachers, writers, and a child psychologist on board, News-O-Matic takes news for kids seriously and hope kids will find it fun, too.]]></csm:any_good>

This free app allows users to create their own cards to add to the stock cards and to record their own voices on the cards.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Tiny Fish is an arcade game where players navigate a small fish through various hazards. While the game certainly has enemies (like sea urchins and a hunter fish), there's no violence and no other objectionable content. Players can, however, share high scores via the Game Center social network, but participation is optional.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

Players can opt in to Apple's Game Center to track scores and achievements, and for some games, challenge friends. Players can send and receive friend requests using an email address or Game Center nickname, revealing the first and last name associated with each party's Apple ID and, in the case of email requests, the sender's email address. Players can opt to have a private or public profile, which can include a photo. With a public profile, your real name is visible to all other players, and Game Center will recommend you to other players using your real name.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Players navigate a fish around sea urchins and other obstacles to complete the tasks on each level. These can range from staying alive for a set period of time to swimming through (and hovering over) checkpoints to eating a certain amount of food. To move the fish, players simply tilt their device left, right, up or down -- and aim for food or checkpoints, while swimming around obstacles. An arcade mode challenges players to stay alive as long as possible.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Tiny Fish doesn't have a lot of tricks up its sleeve, but it's very good at what it does have. The game ramps up difficulty at an ideal level -- and sticks to a small group of challenges, so it's more about improving skills than learning new ones on the fly. The level-based game is fun, but the arcade mode (challenging players to stay alive as long as possible) is the real test of skill -- and the more fun option for adults. Kids, though, will love the easy controls and gentle difficulty curve.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that SoundingBoard is an accessibility tool that helps kids and adults who are unable to speak (or who have limited speech) to communicate. The design isn't as polished as the very similar app, TapToTalk, but the fact that SoundingBoard is free and offers the ability to create custom picture card sets makes it a good value. Customization is key with this app, so adults and educators should be prepared to put in some time creating picture card sets (called "boards") for kids.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Ease of play" rating="3"><![CDATA[SoundingBoard is somewhat easy to use and navigate. Adults and educators can customize the app for specific users. Creating a custom board is easy, but it takes time. Whether the preloaded boards are relevant or accessible to kids depends on each kid's particular skills and needs. Kids might be confused by the navigation, which opens at a text-only menu screen. The list of boards is also heavily text-based, so adults will need to carefully choose images and key words to represent each board. One challenge with the app's design is that the text beneath each picture is limited depending on the size of the board. Many of the sentences are not visible in their entirety, so kids must rely on the images to determine what the card communicates.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Users with limited speech or communication skills tap on various picture cards in order to express themselves. Each board has from one to nine picture cards, and each card includes image, text, and audio. Parents, educators, and therapists can create custom boards and cards to meet users' particular needs. Individual cards can connect to another board; for example, on one board, kids tap on a picture of a boy eating to express hunger, which then opens to a board showing a selection of food cards.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Accessibility tools are rarely cheap, so the fact that SOUNDINGBOARD is free makes it very appealing. However, the app's slightly clunky design creates several limitations. SoundingBoard opens to a text-only menu, which would be confusing for younger kids or kids with limited literacy skills trying to use the app independently. The existing boards list is also heavily text-based with the exception of a small icon for each board, which again, could make navigation tricky for some kids. In addition, when kids see a board of cards, they are often unable to see the entire text that goes with a card if it's longer than a few words. This means kids have to rely on the images to know what the card will say when tapped.Educators and parents can alleviate some of these issues when creating custom boards. Carefully selecting the images to represent the various boards can help kids navigate to a relevant set of picture cards. And limiting the text for each card can help kids find the phrase they want to express more easily.]]></csm:any_good>

While completing the dot-to-dot puzzles and mastering the number sequences and letters presented in each, kids are challenged to work efficiently and, as a result, they build the concept of how memorization helps efficiency. DotToDot numbers &amp; letters is a simple way for kids to practice basic math and literacy skills through a familiar and fun activity.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that QuickVoice Recorder is a utility program that allows people to record emails, rather than type them. It can be useful for children with special needs who are unable to type or read. The free program is a good test run, but for children (who rarely know how to vocalize just one or two sentence emails), the premium program is a choice worth considering.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Users hit a sizable "Record" button then speak into their phone or tablet, rather than typing out an email. (They can pause at any time.) Upon completion, smaller buttons in the lower part of the screen let them add a title and choose whom to send it to from their contact list (adding a new email requires manual typing). Emails can also be sent as an iPhone ringtone. Users who receive the emails on their iDevice can open them by clicking on them, but some PC users will have to download them and manually select QuickTime to play/"read" them.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[As a business tool, QuickVoice has a few fatal flaws. First, PC users have to do some footwork to figure out how to play the messages. And messages with confidential information could be overheard by anyone nearby. As a tool for special needs children, though, there is some potential. Kids don't have to worry about spelling or typing. They simply record what they want to say and hit send. It's also can be a good tool for kids who want to hear their parents'/grandparents'/friends' voice when they're not around and a phone call isn't an option.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Social Adventures is an activity app for kids who need help thinking about social situations and acting appropriately within them (which probably could include most kids in at least some social skills). Created by speech and occupational therapists, Social Adventures includes an entire eight-week program. Users can follow the program, or can just use the lessons for specific skills. This app is chock-full of rock-solid content so, if used properly and consistently until a kid masters the necessary skills, it can be worth the $19.99 cost.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Social Adventures is an excellent resource to teach kids social skills like personal space, non-verbal cues, compromising, initiating social interaction, and more. While very useful for kids with special needs such as those with autism spectrum disorders or other social challenges, almost all kids can learn skills that will make them more socially aware by playing the games and completing the activities on this app with a parent, teacher, or therapist. For the relatively high price, it would be nice for the app to include more support and extension activities, such as message boards to share experience and questions, more promised content areas, videos of parents and kids illustrating how the activities work, etc. It's helpful that the developers created an eight-week program, but it's not essential to follow it in order for Social Adventures to be effective.

For example, under the "advocating and compromising" category, kids can learn how to politely say "no" to a friend's idea. Kids will also practice following directions, listening skills, self-awareness, making wise decisions, and more.

It comes with two instruments (xylophone and drum kit) and has 12 more available with in-app upgrade. The app's designed to introduce kids to different musical instruments and offers freestyle music making with the option to play along with pre-recorded loops. What sets this app apart from others is that the simulated instruments play like the real thing. The colorful and engaging interface is well designed and very responsive for kids of any age and ability.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Kids choose an instrument, which fills the screen, and play it like the real thing. To make music, they touch the keys on a keyboard or the strings and fretboard of a guitar. Wind instruments aren't blown, but kids touch the part of the instrument that changes the pitch, such as the keys on a sax or the finger holes on the recorder. Kids can also choose 1 of 5 pre-recorded instrument loops to play along with, and explore a treble clef C scale with Do-Re-Mi playback. This play-along app has no recording features.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[MUSIC SPARKLES -- ALL IN ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS COLLECTION HD is a great app for creative exploration of musical instruments. The tunings of the instruments are compatible with the pre-recorded playback loops, so kids are never out of key or sound "off." But the best thing about Music Sparkles is that the instruments play like the real thing. The free version is limited but kids can still jam with it.The musical journey really unfolds with the in-app upgrade, which is like walking into a virtual music shop with interactive acoustic and electric guitars and pianos, pipe organ, accordion, harmonica, recorder, harp, sax, panpipes, and violin. The violin interface is disappointing because it's inauthentic and tricky to play, and it'd be great if the app had more world instruments. Still, Music Sparkles shines on and provides a jam-packed, true-to-life musical experience, making it a fantastic choice for budding musicians of all ages and abilities.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids can also learn listening skills such as playing in key and in rhythm, and music theory like scales, intervals, and singing solfege syllables (Do-Re-Mi). The instruments are polyphonic, so kids can play more than one note at a time and in different octaves, and the keyboards are in 12-note chromatic scales. Though it lacks recording and playback, Music Sparkles is still a fantastically rich and interactive musical experience for little ones.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[How well CHORE PAD works will depend upon how the people in a household use it, and if the system fits a family's philosophy on work and rewards. There's no doubt that it's a well-organized, simple system to use. The system rests heavily on rewards or "penalty stars" to motivate everyone to do the work, and some of the "work" included as possible chores to list are exercise, prayer, writing, and "love you" notes. Of course, you don't have to choose those chores.The underlying message of this system is the idea that being motivated to do things requires reward or demerit -- which may not work for every family and hasn't been proven as an effective tool for building kids' long-term inherent motivation. If chores are a problem around your house, it may be worth a try. But expecting a total change in a family's chore habits due to any app may be a stretch.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids help Hana and Cory rescue sea creatures as they tackle math problems, such as identifying the ice cube with more or fewer fish trapped in it, and popping bubbles with a target number in it. Once they've rescued a sea creature, kids earn a sticker they can play with in the "stickery." Parents can also sign up to receive progress reports that include an explanation of the target skills and games.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[In MERMAID WATERS, kids cycle through math mini-game activities. In one game, for example, they compare the quantity or size of two items, with a 50-50 shot at getting the right answer. For number recognition, kids get a number and have to find all the bubbles with that number in it. For early addition, they get a basic addition problem along with appropriate objects and count the number of objects to solve the problem. The theme of rescuing sea creatures keeps the action going.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Mermaid Waters is a great way to engage kids in math. More feedback would help kids understand when they've gotten an answer correct or incorrect, however the activities are in line with what kids learn in preschool and they're done in a fun and motivating way. The overall theme of Hana and Cory rescuing sea creatures is carried out throughout the activities and levels and is a great way to drive the plot and activities forward. The sticker reward system is a fun touch for kids.As for parents, other apps provide progress reports, but Mermaid Waters takes it a step further by including explanations to help parents understand the goals of the activities and also by suggesting everyday activities so learning doesn't stop with the app.]]></csm:any_good>

Overall, the activities are simple, focusing on the task at hand, yet fun. The app provides clear, illustrative examples so kids can easily see the concept. More feedback and reinforcement from the app or parents would help take it even further. The overarching theme, while simple, helps keep activities more like a game than work.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[CRAZY FORMULA is a maze puzzle game requiring logic and foresight. There are no points to score; players instead piece together mazes to advance through levels. The app is fun and definitely challenging, especially as players progress through the upper levels, and is great for teaching prediction, reasoning, and cause and effect to kids of all learning abilities. The app's touch sensitivity is excellent, which makes for satisfying interaction, and its sound effect (clinking glass test tubes) and jazzy riff music are unobtrusive enough to be ignored or enjoyed (both can be turned off under the options setting).The app's cluttered interface and lack of feedback are disappointing, though. While the focus of the game -- the glass test tube maze users interact with -- is front and center, it's relatively small and takes up only a fraction of the screen space. Several other objects take up more screen space and serve no purpose other than to simulate the look of a science lab, making this app's better if played on an iPad. And while there are occasional tutorials in key levels, Crazy Formula has no in-app hint system; if a player gets stuck on a level, they're on their own to either figure it out or skip the level entirely.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that TextMinder SMS text reminders provides an easy way to send reminders to yourself or your kid via phone as SMS text messages. For example, if you want a reminder to appear on your phone via text daily, you can set it up once and the text message will automatically appear at that time every day. If you register your kid's cell phone number on the TextMinder account, you can use the app on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad to send him or her a reminder to walk the dog every Saturday at 11 a.m. that will arrive on their phone at the scheduled time just like any other text message. This is a handy reminder tool for yourself or for communicating with your kids in a way that grabs their attention.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[To create a free account on TextMinder (after purchase of the app), enter a username and password, the phone number to which you want text reminders delivered, your carrier and time zone (certain carriers do not work with this app, but all major carriers do). Tap the green "Create Reminder" icon and type your reminder, up to 100 characters. Add date and time, as well as whether you want the reminder to repeat hourly, daily, weekdays or weekends, annually, and more. Repeat with as many reminders as you want, and receive reminders on your phone via texts as scheduled.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Reminder apps are only as good as the person who is using them. If used consistently and effectively, TEXTMINDER may be an excellent way to use the everyday sound or vibration of a text message to grab your (or your kid's) attention in order to remember an event or be reminded of a task that happens more than once. The easy-to-use interface makes setting up the reminders quick and simple, and there's nothing to do once you receive the text reminder, no need to shut off an alarm. If you or your kid checks your phone for text messages regularly, TextMinder can be a useful reminder tool.]]></csm:any_good>

Each time they complete 10 problems, kids are rewarded with a wild animal or tree to place on a rotating Earth. They can learn more about that tree or animal and make it dance and move. Questions get progressively more challenging, and parents can customize content and difficulty levels as well as see reports of progress and set daily practice goals.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SPLASH MATH KINDERGARTEN is a pricey app, but with it you'll get a school year's worth of solid math practice aligned with the Common Core standards that may be being used in your kid's school. The visuals and characters are fun, and the dancing animals give kids motivation to finish their 10 questions. The range of question difficulty is pretty broad, going from counting to addition without manipulatives pretty quickly. Although there are some minor faults (some imprecise answers, quirky wording, and lack of voice-over in some areas, for example), overall it's a well-done app.The parental controls and reports really set Splash Math Kindergarten apart. Parents can view their kid's progress, see how long they played by day, and see the questions answered correctly along with percentages. They can also set up goals for kids to practice for a specific amount of time per day or a certain number of question or prizes per day and receive email or push reminders to make sure kids get in their daily math practice.]]></csm:any_good>

Kids will practice counting and number identification and then move into addition with the concept of "one more." They'll work with numbers up to 10, and then numbers beyond 10. They'll work with two- and three-dimensional shapes, and they'll learn measurements in length, weight, and capacity as well as sorting and classifying objects. Kids can touch counters on the screen as they would manipulatives for counting or arithmetic, and they can hear the numbers counted aloud as well, reinforcing the counting sequence.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Feel Electric! is a tremendously creative app that teaches kids emotions and language skills. The app's features -- videos, photos, games, and emotions-related vocabulary building activities -- star the talented young cast of the PBS show The Electric Company showing kids how to express their emotions with words. This app was created in conjunction with a military organization called Military Families Near and Far that supports kids who have parents in the military. There's not much direct focus on military families on this app (at the time of this review, just one video features people in uniform); it's more generally an app to help all kids learn ways to express their emotions in healthy ways and improve their command of the English language at the same time.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[FEEL ELECTRIC! shows clearly how interactive, instructive, engaging, and just plain fun quality, well-planned educational apps can be. Whether your kid is feeling "content," "annoyed," "stressed," or "proud," there are many options here to help him or her learn how express emotions more clearly. Options include three games; a "zany" story maker; Electric Company videos; photos (which you can tag on the screen with stickers indicating how the photos make you feel); an emotion-words glossary with more than 50 words; and a digital diary to record your moods with the help of "Mood Dude," an adorable mood-defining character. Kids can also add their own videos and photos to their own diary. This app is part of a military families initiative to help kids whose parents are deployed express their difficult emotions, but all kids can benefit from learning to connect inner emotions to spoken and written words, rather than repressing them or acting out in destructive ways. So much helpful, real-life learning packed into one free app ... and it's tons of fun, too!]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Wonderful Days - Diary with Style is an excellent app for making multimedia diary entries. Kids can create notes associated with different days and add photos, sound recordings, and their locations. Enabling location services is optional. Diary entries can be saved as PDFs, printed, or shared via email, and the diary itself can be password-protected. Unlike web-searching diary apps like Skrappy, attached photos are drawn from the camera or the photo album, so there is less concern about mature content. On the other hand, songs and videos cannot be included. Entries can also be exported to Evernote, a multimedia notes app that requires users to be at least 13 years old.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[WONDERFUL DAYS - DIARY WITH STYLE isn't the fanciest diary app out there, especially without including video or music. Still, it might be the most fun and easy to use. Adding location is a neat feature, though it has its privacy drawbacks. For Evernote users, the ability to automatically add entries to their notes is a nice touch. Also, for iPhone users, it's great to increase the font size so you can easily read what you're writing. A wonderful way to document your wonderful days!]]></csm:any_good>

The open-ended nature of the app gives kids the freedom of creativity, and the ability to use text, images, and sound allows kids to experiment with multiple forms of expression, although some kids would benefit from more writing support within the app. Because the app saves kids' entries over time, they can look back to see how much their writing skills have improved. Wonderful Days  Diary with Style is a great multimedia creation tool that can encourage kids to make journal writing a daily activity.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

Several of the puzzles involve letters that are said aloud when they are put in the correct place. Kids can also start to recognize letter sounds and shapes. It would have been nice for the developer to pay more attention to details such as font selection -- the non-standard font is not ideal for young kids learning letters. And nouns in Tozzle are capitalized for no apparent reason. Still, it's an app that knows its audience.

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Memory Train is an engaging, fast-moving memory game. It can be helpful for kids who have visual processing issues, as they need to decipher color and shape at a quick pace. It can also be helpful for kids who need help with their working memory, as they need to remember the color shape they saw and identify it with three different paint colors. Kids watch objects move by on the screen as if they're riding on a train with "Spacey" the elephant. Once the objects are out of sight, they need to help Spacey recall the colors, shapes, and patterns of those objects. This game is "language neutral," meaning no spoken words at all, which makes it a bit confusing at the start. But it's easy for kids to catch on with the on-screen prompts. Once they do, hang on! The game gets progressively faster.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

As scenery on the screen appears to move (as though the app's player is riding on a train), and the player watches objects pass by and needs to memorize the shape, color, or pattern of that object. For example, after a blue circle appears, passes by, and exits the screen, a gray circle appears with three buckets of paint around it. Kids have to recall the passing circle was blue and tap the blue paint bucket to earn points and a star. There are 10 levels, and up to four players can have accounts.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[MEMORY TRAIN is a cute, rather brilliant, way to promote attention and memory -- far more engaging than the standard memory flip-card games. Even though the graphics are geared toward younger kids, even kids to age 10 or so can build memory recall skills using this app, so older siblings may enjoy playing against younger ones and still feel challenged because of the increasing difficulty and speedy pace on the higher levels. After each round, kids earn rewards along the train track and watch points rack up for their individual characters. Up to four players can keep running scores on this app. The 10 levels get progressively faster (really fast) and more difficult in memory challenges, such as remembering details within patterns.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Bob Books #1 - Reading Magic is an educational experience that will gently teach young kids early phonics by teaching the sounds that letters make and how to combine them to make short words. The developers take a classic phonics book and turn it into an app. The app successfully replicates the book series' step-by-step phonics instruction by providing four levels with the same sentences. When kids have successfully matched the letters to the words (Level 1) or spelled out the words by choosing the correct letters among many other letters (Level 4), that object gets filled in with color. When kids have completed the sentence, the whole scene comes alive. An HD version is also available in iTunes.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Bob Books #2 - Reading Magic HD is an interactive reading and spelling app for very beginning readers. It presents 12 pages of a book, which can be played on four different levels where kids spell most of the words in each sentence, one at a time. The pictures on each page starts out as black and white, and slowly fill with color as kids spell the words. The words, letters, and sentences are all read or sounded out for the child, with repetition and spelling tasks teaching step by step. The four levels gradually increase in difficulty, from dragging and dropping letters to match words, to selecting letters on your own to spell the given words. On each level, tapping words or letters results in their being read or sounded out loud. Once some of the pages on a level are completed, the level selection screen shows how many pages out of 12 have been completed for each level.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[BOB BOOKS #2 - READING MAGIC HD is a continuation from Bob Books #1 Reading Magic. It presents 12 new scenes and sentences. As with the first app, this app successfully replicates the book series' step-by-step phonics instruction by providing four levels with the same sentences. When kids have successfully matched the letters to the words (Level 1) or spelled out the words by choosing the correct letters among many other letters (Level 4), that object gets filled in with color. When kids have completed the sentence, the whole scene comes alive.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Bob Books #2 Reading Magic HD is an excellent literacy app that teaches early reading in a gentle, interactive way. Kids slowly become more comfortable with letter sounds, reading short words, and spelling as they go through the 12 pages on each of the four levels. The artwork and feel of the app is the same as for the printed Bob Books, with the addition of soothing colors, fun animation, interactive games, and a gentle voice.]]></csm:any_good>

The app is designed to take kids from letter and letter-sound recognition to being able to spell and sound out short words on their own. Using the same 12 sentences in four levels that progressively get harder lets kids directly build on their knowledge as they go through each level. While the words taught here are limited, the letters and their sounds are the basis of many other words. Bob Books #2 Reading Magic HD does a very good job providing the basics for learning phonics and how to read.]]></csm:what_kids_can_learn>

Once an image is chosen, a hollowed-out version of it appears with a few adjacent blocks lining the side of the screen. As kids choose correctly, more blocks appear to choose from, or kids can scroll down if they want to see more right away. There's also one more basic game that just shows shapes and provides voice direction to help younger kids learn individual shapes by matching shapes with color cues ("Match the yellow triangle") that only correspond with one shape choice.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SHAPES &amp; PUZZLES BY PIRATE TRIO is colorful, fun, and just enough of a challenge without too many choices to overwhelm young app users. If kids have played other apps by this developer, they'll recognize the cute pirates encouraging them on in their learning adventures. It may be frustrating for the youngest players here to see that a block shape matches the necessary spot on the puzzle only to find that it doesn't "fit" because that particular one isn't turned in the correct direction. In that instance, players have to go back to find the same shape that's positioned at a different angle to fit. But it's also a good opportunity to learn spatial relations and viewing shapes in a different way. Overall, this app is in the top tier of the many good shape-teaching apps for preschoolers.]]></csm:any_good>

Choose which runway planes land on and which terminal they visit. Help them receive maintenance and gas. Planes are happiest when they use a terminal that matches their color, so you'll need to plan ahead to keep them all organized and in good spirits. After each round, you'll be able to take your hard-earned virtual cash and buy upgrades for your airport.

      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[AIRPORT MANIA: FIRST FLIGHT is a fun game that's just a little bit different from other time management apps. Each of the planes has a different personality, and it's fun to watch them as they get angry about delays. If you make a mistake, though, no one gets hurt. Angry planes just head off to a different airport. Occasionally, you'll get a plane with a special icon. You might need to quickly land due to a pregnant woman on board, or an organ for an organ transplant. Completing these tasks will nab you special awards in your trophy room. The only real flaw in this game is that it doesn't always recognize a tap on the screen (as tested on an iPod touch). There are 48 replayable levels, so the app will keep players busy for a while.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Comic Life is all about creativity. Users are able to transform their own personal photos from their mobile device and bring them to life in an interactive comic book. Any photo will do, no matter how seemingly boring or mundane. This app is for more than just budding comic book artists though. Anyone can pick-up-and-play, with user-friendly and intuitive controls that make every process -- from adding cartoon-style graphics, speech bubbles, and giant action words, to editing images on-the-fly, to setting the layout of each comic book page -- simple and enjoyable. Once complete, the creations can be shared through social media sites, email, or sent directly to a wireless printer to create a hard copy.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[COMIC LIFE allows users to take their ordinary, everyday photos and turn them into an exciting comic book adventure. However, the level of customization feels somewhat limited. The available templates are bland and have no special flavor or feeling, and the number of fonts, speech bubbles, and canned photos is limited. Additionally, because it acts more like a computer program than a mobile app, the controls are sometimes clunky. As a result, this app does have value and anyone with a little creativity can unleash a fair share of masterpieces with this, but it may fall short of some users' expectations.]]></csm:any_good>
