Up to six real players can participate in a game (as well as the six computer-controlled characters) for a total of twelve. Kids can play up to 20 turns for free, then must pay a $14.99 per year subscription to unlock the full version.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[As the president of a trading company in GAZILLIONAIRE!, players travel to different planets, buy up goods at low prices, then sell them on different planets at a profit. Through charts, players can monitor the demand of goods across the solar system to decide which planet to travel to next. Like The Oregon Trail, players frequently encounter random events that require them to make decisions, and the result can either be harmful or beneficial. The goal is to be the first company to achieve a predetermined amount of wealth (which changes depending on the game's difficulty level), while competing against computer opponents and, optionally, up to six real players.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Gazillionaire! isn't the most polished package, and kids will spend a lot of time looking at charts and menus. But the game tackles the potentially dry subject of economics with enthusiasm, humor, and creativity. The ability to adjust the difficulty by toggling specific features on and off is a huge plus. Players can opt for a relatively stress-free experience by sticking with the tutorial settings, or add features like fuelling, staffing, advertising, taxes, and stocks for a more complex and realistic business sim. Kids will have fun while learning about important principles of the economy.]]></csm:any_good>

Players use a handful of modes and can use an interactive board game or a game show-type setting or just play one game at a time. Some of the mini-games involve minor cartoon violence like shooting cartoon cannons or lasers, but nothing about the content is gratuitous or overtly aggressive. No one is ever shown hurt. The app gives kids an opportunity to interact with others helping to increase socialization. Using the Wii remote can help kids who struggle with fine motor issues.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[WII PARTY U is a collection of more than 80 mini-games. The wildly varied mini-games include everything from a no-holds-barred animal-racing game to short sequences where the outcome is pure luck of the draw. There are several game modes that utilize these mini-games in differing ways. In addition to interactive board games in which players compete to determine their order, there are also modes wherein players try to see how well they know one another. There's also an option for players to ditch the TV entirely and play games with the Wii U's GamePad controller.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Wii Party U is one of the increasingly rare examples of a video game that works perfectly if you have four people together in the same room. It's just good old-fashioned fun. The game also is tailored to work with two or three players. Although it can be fun to play with the single-player options between multiplayer game sessions, that's not where the meat of the game is. The various game modes help keep the game fresh for a long time.There are also some very unique uses for the Wii U GamePad controller, including mini-games wherein one player looks at the GamePad screen while everyone else sees a different perspective on the TV, as well as mini-games that use the GamePad exclusively. The bottom line: When it comes to choosing a video game that a group of people can play at the same time, Wii Party U is an easy recommendation. It's not quite as good if you don't have four, as it will add a virtual player to many of the games. Regardless, it's a must-add to any Wii U library.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[While its focus is on Disney songs and characters, Just Dance: Disney Party is very similar to previous Just Dance games. Players dance in front of the television, mimicking the moves of characters onscreen (typically kids or young adults dressed up as the characters from the film or show providing the music). The movements of Xbox 360 users are picked up by the Kinect sensor, while Wii players use the Wii remote to let the game track their movements. Kids can play songs in a non-stop shuffle or make their own playlists. Wii users have an added game mode, letting them pop onscreen balloons to earn more points.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Kids and parents alike will find something to enjoy with Just Dance: Disney Party. The music is a good blend of classic Disney tunes (ranging from "The Bare Necessities" to "Under the Sea" to "It's a Small World") and Disney Channel favorites from acts like Camp Rock and Wizards of Waverly Place. The game features 25 songs, which is notably lower than other installments in the franchise, but they're all tailored to younger players. The dance moves are easy and the game is forgiving with its scoring, which will keep young kids from getting frustrated.Veterans of the series might bemoan the lack of innovation, but it's a game meant to bring younger players into the fold -- and they're likely to be delighted with the familiar songs and the chance to dance around the living room with abandon.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[Carmen Sandiego's crew of V.I.L.E. villains are at it again in CARMEN SANDIEGO ADVENTURES IN MATH: THE GREAT GATEWAY GRAB. One of her henchmen (or henchwomen) has masterminded the theft of the Gateway of India, a 100-year-old monument in Mumbai, and it's up to the player to find out who. Kids start by selecting a one of the game's stock detectives (there are a few men and women of different ethnicities from which to choose), then head to India to begin questioning people and looking for clues. They'll encounter and solve ten contextual math problems -- connecting wires, bypassing fingerprint readers, weighing pineapples -- as they collect information that will eventually allow them to identify the culprit. Expect the whole adventure to last about an hour. A practice mode lets kids go back and retry the math problems again and again, with different numeric values inserted each time.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The Great Gateway Grab is a fine learning game for kids. Its math problems are well balanced, suitable for its target age group (middle-elementary school kids), and make sense within the context of the investigation. Plus, its story has some interesting twists and turns, not least of which is a dilemma concerning the containment of a solvent that can dissolve any container. (We'd still like to know whether the novel solution used in the game has any basis in reality!)You get what you pay for -- the production values are decidedly low, and it's no longer than an after-school special -- but the educational value is good and the mystery is compelling. The math problems are fun, and kids can replay them over and over again.]]></csm:any_good>

Players physically emulate several sports, which means kids are engaged in healthy, vigorous movement as well fun social interaction should they choose to play with friends. The only iffy content is a boxing game that has players swinging controller-wielding fists in hopes of making contact with their virtual opponent, who grunts when struck, sometimes looks dazed, and may fall to the ground unconscious. Note that this game can be played with just one PlayStation Move controller (even in multiplayer matches), but that it becomes a deeper and more authentic experience with two.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[The follow-up to one of PlayStation Move's most popular launch games, SPORTS CHAMPIONS 2 offers five new activities -- golf, bowling, tennis, skiing, and boxing -- and brings back archery, a favorite from the original. Each of the games requires players to make authentic movements, similar to those that they would use were they playing the sport in the real world. Boxing involves throwing punches, blocking, and dodging, golf requires strong straight swings with fluid wrist movements, and skiing has players pulling themselves forward by their poles and raising and lowering their hands to steer. The single-player mode allows kids to work through 18 events in each sport that also trains them in each activity's subtler techniques. A free mode lets players simply play or train however they like; and a party mode has up to four players working through regiments of activities in friendly competition. Regardless of mode, players can create and customize their own avatars, choosing gender and skin color and selecting from various clothing items they unlock throughout the game.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[SPORTS CHAMPIONS 2 is a nice showcase for PlayStation Move. It demonstrates the technology's impressive precision and reliability, delivering true one-to-one control that virtually never fails. For example, it accurately and consistently detects speed, spin, aim, and loft when throwing bowling balls. And shooting arrows -- a process that involves drawing, notching, pulling back, and loosing -- is remarkably intuitive and feels very authentic.It's only real issue is a case of the "blands." Like most sports-themed game collections, it doesn't have much in the way of personality. Characters are generic, even with the ability to change outfits and hairstyles, and the prevailing visual aesthetic is very ACME in vibe. If the sequel adds a bit of panache while maintaining spot-on controls, Sony may have the motion-controlled sports compilation game to beat.]]></csm:any_good>

In this version, players use the Nintendo DS stylus to slice, stir, chop, and plate their way through 80 new recipes including chilli con carne, mushroom quiche, and pumpkin gnocchi. The game's cheerful host walks the player through each recipe step-by-step and awards a score and medal based on how perfectly they're able to prepare each dish. There's also Let's Cook! mode where players run through the entire recipe without any pauses, Let's Match! Mode where players choose any two ingredients and create a custom recipe, and Let's Shop where players shop for ingredients by guiding Mama through a supermarket while avoiding obstacles.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Cooking Mama's gameplay suits the Nintendo DS particularly well. There's plenty to do and a ton of extra material to unlock  players can decorate a digital diary with stickers, dress up Mama in new outfits, and change in-game colors and backgrounds. For the first time, players can import food they've grown in the sister title Gardening Mama to use in recipes. The game also boasts a local multiplayer mode where friends can face off in 20 timed challenges.The one downside is that instructions aren't always clear the first time around, but it's a small complaint since the mini-games are easily and quickly replayed. Like its predecessors, Cooking Mama 3 is full of cute visual touches, like batter that is stirred too quickly slopping out of the pan and then has to be rubbed off the screen with the stylus. Cooking Mama 3 not only challenges kids and adults alike with clever, surprisingly detailed cooking minigames, but payers might actually learn a thing or two about food prep.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that LeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Pet Pals 2: Best of Friends! is a great introductory title for the Leapster Explorer and LeapPad Explorer. Unlike some of the other games, this one does not follow a set story line. Kids are free to explore, play games, and take care of their puppy. It does have an emphasis on consumer behavior, as you are given coins for doing certain tasks (including being a good friend) and are encouraged to buy clothes, toys, and premium food for your puppy. The game also supports Micromods, which allow kids to connect online and download additional game-related content, and the LeapFrog Learning Path where parents can track their kids' progress in the game.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[LEAPFROG EXPLORER LEARNING GAME: PET PALS 2: BEST OF FRIENDS! invites the player to adopt a puppy, name him/her, and then care for this new friend. Puppies need to be bathed, played with, fed, dressed, and entertained. Kids earn Puppy Points for nurturing their pets. As they earn more points, they increase in rank and are eventually able to adopt additional friends. Outside of the virtual house, there are plenty of other things to do. Kids can shop at the Pup Boutique or the Bark Mark for clothes, food, and toys. They can visit the training center to learn new tricks or the park to play with friends. There's a dog show where kids demonstrate their ability to bathe and dress their pet, and also show off their math skills (addition and subtraction).Kids can earn trophies and coins that they can use to shop. While walking around outside, they also have the chance to make friends with the 10 other puppies who live in town. If they can tell what emotion the puppies are feeling (from a multiple choice set of images), they can build up their friendship and possibly earn prizes. And if they're in need of more cash, they can try out the Treasure Hunt, where they can earn coins and collectible items. Much like other games, they earn badges for completing tasks and meeting goals.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Pet Pals 2: Best of Friends! is a cute game that will have a lot of appeal across gender lines in the target age range. Because it doesn't require a lot of special knowledge or gaming skill, it skews younger, but picking out your own puppy and playing with it does have universal appeal. Although there is no set storyline and no "end goal," kids may enjoy trying to become "best friends" with all of the puppies in town and finding all of the collectibles in the treasure hunt. Other kids will simply enjoy the day-to-day care of the puppies without being concerned about completing things. This one is a good staple for the library of Leapster Explorer/LeapPad Explorer owners, especially those on the younger side.]]></csm:any_good>

Learning to look in one place while you write or draw in another doesn't come naturally, though, and the cord sometimes feels a bit short for the peripheral, resulting in the stylus not being where you want it to be on screen.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[uDRAW STUDIO: INSTANT ARTIST is a virtual art studio for the Xbox 360, PS3, and the Wii (an earlier version for the Wii, with slightly different software, was released in 2010).  The program, which is more a tool of self-expression than a game, lets players create art with everything from paints and crayons to chalk and buckets of paint (for large areas), all of which appear on screen. There are also stamps (including some that animate) and other finishes to customize your art. You draw by using the uDraw stylus on the uDraw GameTablet, which, for the PS3 or Xbox 360 versions, has buttons built into it. The game comes with a detailed tutorial, which helps players to build their art skills and learn about color palates. It also has an area for creating your own art, as well as a series of art games (such as paint-by-numbers and dot-to-dot pictures) categorized as going to Art Camp.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[The expansion of uDRAW to the PS3 and Xbox 360 brings a very family-friendly option to both systems and opens up the artistic side of both. This game (which is also available as a standalone title for the Wii) is broken into three parts, each of which emphasizes self-expression in a different way. Art Camp lets kids participate in a half-dozen activities, such as paint-by-numbers and dot-to-dot pictures -- as well as an arcade-like game where you whack aliens who fly across the canvas. (It's a cute idea, but not a lot of fun.)Art Studio is literally an open canvas, letting players use the game to create whatever they'd like via the peripheral. And Art School is a very thorough tutorial full of instructions on how to improve your art skills, covering all of the basics of art and design. The interface keeps tools on screen; and players can share and send images. While it's a wonderful artistic tool, the peripheral isn't perfect. The cord feels short and users will fight against it from time to time, which can be annoying -- and drawing on a peripheral in your lap, while watching it appear on screen isn't any easier than it was on the 2010 Wii game of a similar name. (Should you own that one, there's more to this game, but probably not enough to justify paying full price.)]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that Active Life Magical Carnival is a collection of fantasy-themed mini-games that are intended to keep kids up and active while playing. The game uses both the standard Wii remotes and a special floor mat that track their foot movements. One or two mini-games feature mild, very unrealistic cartoon violence. The games are set in themed worlds including circus, pirates, and wizards.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[ACTIVE LIFE MAGICAL CARNIVAL invites families to step into a fantasy theme park full of motion-controlled mini-games. You will tame lions and walk tightropes under a circus big top; you'll ride broomsticks and chase ghosts in a wizard's castle; you'll climb masts and duel buccaneers on a pirate ship; and more. Games are played with both the Wii remote and the Active Life floor pad.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Active Life Magical Carnival, like the rest of the Active Life series, makes excellent use of its distinct, two-person floor pad. Having to step, jump, run, and hop throughout a game definitely increases the overall physicality of it. And most of the time, the actions fit well with the game's designated activity (pedaling, lunging, etc.). There are times, mostly when steering vehicles (including broomsticks), when leaning would have felt more natural, as opposed to stepping. But if the game used, say, the Wii balance board instead, then you wouldn't be able to jump on it. So nothing is perfect, but the developers here have done a great job with the hardware they chose to use. Plus, it's fun to see the kind of active gaming moves usually reserved for sports titles applied to a fantasy-adventure setting.]]></csm:any_good>

It can be purchased with the Wii Balance Board or as a separate disc if you already own the Wii Balance Board. This upgraded version provides 15 new games bringing the total activities to over 60 covering yoga, strength training, aerobics, and balance games. New to this version is the ability to create your own workout and to play multiplayer. By providing you with your own virtual trainer and encouraging you to play every day, Wii Fit Plus helps to make working out fun for all ages. Parents with kids who are sensitive about their body image need to know that this program uses Body Mass Index (BMI) to label users who have created profiles as either underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. For children, that label may be inaccurate because they are growing so fast.

      <csm:description><![CDATA[WII FIT PLUS contains the original Wii Fit game with expanded content and a navigational face-lift. The expanded content gives you 15 more balance and aerobic games, as well as 3 new Yoga poses and 3 new strength training exercises. The original Wii Fit has 40 activities, while this new expanded version has 60. Also new is the ability to see your calories burned during your play session. In terms of navigation, you can now personalize your workout so that you can exercise your way through a series of activities without having to break in between to deal with navigation screens. You can select from a series of options to build your own workout, including deciding its intensity and length of time. Some of the fun new games include an obstacle course where you time your running to avoid giant swinging balls (ala the popular Japanese game shows), and one where you flap your arms while leaning forward to fly onto targets set in the ocean.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[Yes, this is an improvement over the excellent Wii Fit. If you have been thinking about buying Wii Fit but haven't gotten around it yet, buy the Wii Fit Plus version that comes bundled with the Wii Balance Board for $99.99, which is only $10 more than the original. If you already own Wii Fit, you can buy just the new disc for $19.99. If you have kids, this decision is easy. $20 is a great price for the 15 additional games that will get your kids moving. Even adults will enjoy the games, although kids may be better at virtual skateboarding and snowball fighting. But don't get too keyed up over the multiplayer mode  it isn't head-to-head split screen. It is about taking turns and seeing whose score is better.The ability to create your own workout is also an improvement, but this personalization isn't completely open. You cannot simply choose to string a series of the zany games together as a workout (which is what kids would love). Instead you have to target a body part or a type of exercise. Nonetheless, this is better than the original Wii Fit where you had to stop between each activity. Wii Fit Plus makes doing exercises fun and motivates both kids and adults to get up and get moving.]]></csm:any_good>

      <csm:parents_need_to_know><![CDATA[Parents need to know that The Sims Social is a life simulation game in The Sims series that is played on the Facebook social network. Players create their own person, known as a "Sim," by customizing appearance and selecting personality traits including introvert, geek, socialite, tycoon, romantic, or villain. These traits influence the Sim's behavior. Sims can enter into friendships, rivalries, and both heterosexual and same-sex romantic relationships with other Sims, which are controlled by Facebook friends. These relationships statuses must be approved by both players before appearing in the game. Sims do not have children, age, or die. Players can spend real-world money to purchase special items or to speed up the game by instantly unlocking quests and building furniture. The game is more fun with more friends to visit, which might tempt players to "friend" strangers on Facebook to get more neighbors.]]></csm:parents_need_to_know>

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Consumerism" rating="2"><![CDATA[Players can buy a range of items for their Sim's house. The game encourages buying "nice" stuff, because it increases the value of the property. Sims can buy Dunkin' Donuts branded coffee and donuts.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Positive messages" rating="2"><![CDATA[Sims can be as pleasant or nasty as the player chooses, and will cultivate friendly or confrontational relationships with other Sims through their actions. It's possible for Sims to pickpocket other Sims, steal their food, pee on their plants, play dozens of different pranks, and choose insulting or hurtful conversation topics like calling someone a bad friend or mocking their appearance. There are just as many positive interactions too, from playing music and dancing together to sharing jokes and small-talk.]]></csm:content_grid_item>
        <csm:content_grid_item name="Ease of play" rating="4"><![CDATA[Gameplay is more streamlined than The Sims for PC and consoles, with fewer menu options and a fixed camera.

        <csm:content_grid_item name="Positive role models" rating="2"><![CDATA[A Sim's behavior is influenced by its personality traits and its relationship status with other Sims. Sims with the villain personality trait will actually derive pleasure in causing other Sims distress. Sims in a romantic relationship can dump each other and become Ex-Lovers. However, there are many positive traits as well, and those serve as positive role models.]]></csm:content_grid_item>
        <csm:content_grid_item name="Privacy &amp; safety" rating="3"><![CDATA[Some privacy concerns. Players will be prompted regularly to post game-related status updates on their Facebook wall, and on the walls of friends. Interacting with other Sims is a big part of the game, and players might be tempted to "friend" strangers on Facebook to increase their number of neighbors.]]></csm:content_grid_item>
        <csm:content_grid_item name="Sex" rating="3"><![CDATA[A player's Sim can pursue both heterosexual and same-sex relationships with the Sims of Facebook friends, but both friends must approve changes in relationship status for it to take effect. Sims that are romantically involved can exchange passionate kisses and hugs, have "quickies" in the shower, or make "woohoo" (the game's long-standing euphemism for sexual intercourse). These interactions are accompanied by floating hearts, groans and giggles, but nothing graphic.]]></csm:content_grid_item>
        <csm:content_grid_item name="Violence" rating="1"><![CDATA[Sims can argue and get into catfights with each other, but these are handled humorously and there's no graphic violence.]]></csm:content_grid_item>

      <csm:description><![CDATA[THE SIMS SOCIAL is The Sims streamlined for social networks. Players care for only one Sim in this version (as opposed to an entire family), by making sure that its personal needs such as hygiene, hunger, and fun are being met. Instead of having an entire neighborhood to explore, Sims are limited to their own house and yard -- which can be expanded with new rooms and outfitted with hundreds of furniture and decorative items purchased from the shop. Sims can also visit the houses of other Sims, which become available by inviting Facebook friends to become neighbors.]]></csm:description>
      <csm:any_good><![CDATA[For all its pruning, The Sims Social still feels like a "Sims" game -- in fact, some players will even appreciate that there's less to micromanage. Some of the attempts to copy popular social game mechanics fall flat -- like the superficial crop-tending and weed-pulling tasks -- but overall the social features complement the gameplay. Watching the Sims interact with their environment, and with each other, is the highlight of the game. Players can earn money, learn new skills, and cultivate relationships with other Sims through interactions. Almost everything in the game environment can be clicked on, resulting in reactions from the Sims that range from adorable (two friendly Sims performing a piano duet), to quirky (a "crazy" Sim satisfying her social needs by talking to the plants in her yard). Some of these actions use energy, but many of them don't, so even after players have used up all their free energy there's still entertainment to be had. These features help make The Sims Social an engaging social game with depth and humor.]]></csm:any_good>
